This infection was a zombie plague, and when the Avengers of Earth-2149 arrived at the scene of the Sentry's arrival, he infected them all. Soon the Avengers would spread the plague to other heroes, and before long the entire world became either infected or devoured.</p><p>Before long though, the Marvel Zombies ran out of food. While some of the zombies such as Iron Man, Spider-Man, and Wolverine, gained the powers of Galactus, others stayed behind and used cloning technologies to continue eating. Years later, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Wolverine, and the others came back to Earth to find that Black Panther had survived and created a new life for the survivors of the plague. Running low on food it wouldn't be long until the hunger took over, and the zombies found a way to cross universes.</p><p>Soon the zombies came to Earth-616 resulting in the creation of A.R.M.O.R. to combat the zombie infestation. They travel between Universes to help rid them of the zombie plague and to prevent it from spreading into the Marvel Universe.</p><h2>Full Plot</h2><h3>Dead Days</h3><p>A strange lightning in the sky struck New York. There it shows a zombified Sentry infecting the Avengers. The Avengers then went around eating the citizens and infecting other heroes/villains. All remaining heroes retreat to the S.H.I.E.L.D hellicarrier to plan for an attack on the zombies. Tony Stark and Reed Richards plan for a way to solve the problem but Reed goes mad and infects the Fantastic Four having the hellicarrier become infected. Stark makes a dimensional teleporter and has the remaining heroes escort it away while he gets infected. Nick Fury then decides to destroy the teleporter so the zombies will be stuck in this universe.</p><h3>Ultimate Fantastic Four; Crossover</h3><p>It didn't take long for the zombies to eat most of the population. The zombied heroes are still hungry, so they manipulate Reed Richards from the ultimate universe to build the dimensional teleporter that Stark created. The teleporter was made but was then destroyed by Magneto to once again prevent the zombies from infecting the ultimate universe.</p><h3>Marvel Zombies 1</h3><p>Magneto destroyed the teleporter and is on the run trying to return to his base on asteroid M. Unfortunately he was found by zombie heroes and fought. Magneto put up a great fight but was defeated and eaten by zombie Captain America (now called colonel america), Spider-Man, Hulk, Thor, Luke Cage, Hank Pym, Wasp, Wolverine, and Daredevil. After that they are discussing how the biology of being a zombie works which they can't figure out.They then see the Silver Surfer but disappears quickly. The group then reunites with Zombie Iron man who is angry about the group eating magneto without him. meanwhile zombie Hank Pym sneaks into a secret lab where he has a sedated Black Panther who Hank uses as a secret meal. He then amputates his leg for a meal until zombie Wasp finds Hank and asks him to split Black Panther with her. Hank then kills Wasp by biting her head off but spits it out because of bad taste. Meanwhile the group encounter the Silver Surfer again. Silver Surfer tells the zombies Galactus is coming to devour the planet but the zombie's respond by attacking him. The surfer puts up good fight by destroying Iron man's legs and burning Hulk's face. Unfortunately The Silver Surfer is defeated by the Hulk by biting his head off. So Colonel America, Spider-man, Wolverine, Hank Pym, Iron man, and Luke Cage eat the Silver Surfer and gain the surfers cosmic powers. They then show off their powers by destroying almost every other zombie. Meanwhile, Black Panther (missing an arm and a leg) escaped the lab with Wasp (now only a head) to find a group of mutants who are searching for Magneto. At first they reject T'Challa because he has zombie Wasp but later accept him and they escape to Asteroid M where Black Panther was able to get a prosthetic arm and leg from Forge. Back on Earth, Galactus has reached Earth and easily overpowers the cosmic zombies. The zombies then retreat to Hank Pym's secret lab to build a cannon that can destroy Galactus. They then fuel it with their cosmic powers and knocks Galactus unconscious. They then see a group of zombie villains going to try to eat Galactus but is easily defeated except Colonel America who was killed by zombie Red Skull. The cosmic zombies then go and eat Galactus gaining his powers. It is then shown years later and Asteroid M landed on earth. Black Panter and Wasp (now with a robotic body) find earth not inhabited by anything so they start to rebuild. Meanwhile we see a alien planet being attacked by the zombies who are now dressed like Galactus.</p><h3>Ultimate Fantastic Four; Frightful</h3><h3>Black Panther</h3><h3>Marvel Zombies 2</h3><p>Many years later the cosmic zombies (Spider-man, Wolverine, Iron man, Luke Cage, Hank Pym, Hulk) and a couple new zombies (Phoenix, Thanos, Gladiator, Firelord) ate everything in the known universe.Thanos blamed Hulk for biting more than he can chew which resulted in Hulk killing Thanos. Hank then remembered the dimensional teleporter that they can rebuild and use to find more food. So the zombies began their journey to earth. Meanwhile on earth. Black Panther (now an old man) is leader of New Wakanda and is learning that they don't have enough people to sustain a population and fears extinction, also they found the head of zombie Hawkeye who's still alive but can't remember much after being buried for so many years. Also there's a mutant resistance group that is planning to assassinate Black Panther. So that night, and assassin came and stabbed Panther in the gut fatally wounding him. Zombie Wasp comes in and incapacitates the assassin. She then sees the only way of keeping Panther alive is by turning him into a zombie. So she bites him but doing this has returned her hunger and tries to eat Black Panther's wife but Panther (now a zombie) stops her and tells her to help him eat the assassin. Panther and Wasp then go into a reinforced safe to get over the hunger. Later, Black Panther and Wasp are cured of the hunger and leave only to find the leader of the resistance group <a href=\"/malcolm-cortez/4005-48899/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48899\">Malcolm Cortez</a> rant about Panther becoming a zombie roweling up the crowd. Then the other zombies appear. Hank Pym shocked by there being some humans left suggest making a breeding program so they can eat humans forever. In an anger, Spider-man shoots the top of hank's head. Spider-man tells them they used to be heroes and they should learn to get over the hunger because Spider-man and Luke Cage already got over it. In response the rest of the zombies attack Spider-man and Luke cage. Black Panther and wasp came to assist until the people put up force field keeping the zombies out except Gladiator. Spider-man, Luke cage, Black Panther, and wasp then fought Gladiator. Gladiator was proven stronger than them combined. Forge then came wearing a new and improved Iron man armor and holds down Gladiator for Spider-man and Luke Cage to blast Gladiator's head off. The zombies outside the barrier then left to look for the teleporter. The good zombies then went into the city to get prosthetic limbs. Meanwhile the zombies finally reached Earth and head to Stark industries to look for the teleporter but are attacked by the buildings security which made Stark believe someone already came here and took the teleporter. Later, Forge showed the good zombies the teleporter and told them they better prepare for the other zombie's return. Also forge also helped even the battle by revealing Black Panther's son who has a chunk of Captain America's brain inside.The bad zombies returned and the good zombies fought them but they eventually got into the city. Hank Pym was about to eat a person until the hunger vanished in him. Hank then saw all the horrible things he did and told the other zombies to stop. The Hulk then tried eating people and all the zombies fought Hulk but Hulk killed Phoenix, Firelord, hawkeye, and Iron man. Then a man came and sacrificed himself to the hulk causing hulk to turn into banner where the zombies killed him. After all this they plan to use the teleporter to teleport the remaining humans to a different dimension until Malcolm came and teleported the zombies away making Malcolm leader of New Wakanda.</p><h3>Marvel Zombies Return</h3><h2>Chronological Order</h2><ul><li>Marvel Zombies: Dead Days</li><li><blockquote>Marvel Zombies vs. Army of Darkness</blockquote></li><li>Marvel Zombies: Evil Evolution</li><li><blockquote><span>Marvel Apes</span></blockquote></li><li>Ultimate Fantastic Four, issues 21-23 <i>(Original Appearance)</i></li><li>Marvel Zombies</li><li>Ultimate Fantastic Four, issues 30-32</li><li>Black Panther, issues 28-30</li><li>Marvel Zombies 2</li><li>Marvel Zombies Return</li><li>Marvel Zombies 3</li><li>Marvel Zombies 4</li><li><blockquote><span>Deadpool: Merc with a Mouth</span></blockquote></li><li>Marvel Zombies 5</li><li>Marvel Zombies Supreme</li><li>Marvel Zombies Destroy</li></ul><h2><span>Collected Editions</span></h2><ul><li><a href=\"/ultimate-fantastic-four-crossover/4050-22166/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-22166\">Ultimate Fantastic Four: Crossover</a></li><li><a href=\"/ultimate-fantastic-four-frightful/4050-22167/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-22167\">Ultimate Fantastic Four: Frightful</a></li><li><span><a href=\"/marvel-zombies/4050-57825/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-57825\">Marvel Zombies</a> (#1–5)</span></li><li><span><a href=\"/marvel-zombies-dead-days/4050-32703/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-32703\">Marvel Zombies: Dead Days</a> (Ultimate Fantastic Four #21–23, 30–32, Marvel Zombies: Dead Days, Black Panther vol. 3 #28–30)</span></li><li><span><span><a href=\"/marvel-apes-evolution-starts-here/4050-32625/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-32625\">Marvel Apes: Evolution Starts Here</a> (Collects the Marvel Apes specials)</span></span></li><li><span><a href=\"/marvel-zombies-2/4050-32704/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-32704\">Marvel Zombies 2</a> (#1-5)</span></li><li><span><a href=\"/marvel-zombies-3/4050-32872/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-32872\">Marvel Zombies 3</a> (#1-4)</span></li><li><span><a href=\"/marvel-zombies-4/4050-32986/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-32986\">Marvel Zombies 4</a> (#1-4)</span></li><li><span><a href=\"/marvel-zombies-return/4050-33018/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-33018\">Marvel Zombies: Return</a> (#1-5)</span></li><li><span><a href=\"/marvel-zombies-5/4050-36370/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-36370\">Marvel Zombies 5</a> (#1-5)</span></li><li><span><a href=\"/marvel-zomnibus/4050-57829/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-57829\">Marvel Zomnibus HC</a> (Ultimate Fantastic Four #21–23, 30–32, Marvel Zombies #1–5, Marvel Zombies: Dead Days, Black Panther vol. 3 #28–30, Marvel Apes: Prime Eight, Marvel Zombies 2 #1-5, Marvel Zombies 3 #1–4, Marvel Zombies 4 #1–4, Marvel Zombies: Return #1–5, Marvel Zombies: Evil Evolution, Marvel Zombies 5 #1–5, Marvel Zombies Supreme #1–5)</span></li><li><a href=\"/black-panther-four-the-hard-way/4050-30150/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-30150\">Black Panther: Four the Hard Way</a> (#26-30)</li><li><span><span><span><a href=\"/marvel-zombies-supreme/4050-43025/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-43025\">Marvel Zombies Supreme</a> (#1–5)</span></span></span></li><li>Marvel Zombies Destroy <span>(#1-5)</span> <span>*Solicited March 2013</span></li></ul><h2>Related Issues</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/the-official-handbook-of-the-marvel-universe-the-official-handbook-of-the-marvel-universe-alternate-universes-2005/4000-106689/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-106689\">The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #17</a></li><li><span><span><a href=\"/marvel-zombies-vs-army-of-darkness/4050-18236/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18236\">Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness</a> (#1–5)</span></span></li><li><span><span><a href=\"/marvel-zombies-christmas-carol/4050-41041/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-41041\">Marvel Zombies Christmas Carol</a> (#1-5)</span></span></li><li><span><a href=\"/deadpool-merc-with-a-mouth/4050-26958/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-26958\">Deadpool: Merc With a Mouth</a> (#1-13)</span></li><li><span><span><a href=\"/marvel-zombies-the-covers/4050-49830/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-49830\">Marvel Zombies: The Covers</a></span></span></li><li><a href=\"/marvel-zombies-halloween/4050-53119/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-53119\">Marvel Zombies Halloween</a></li><li><a href=\"/marvel-zombies-the-book-of-angels-demons-various-monstrosities/4050-19223/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-19223\">Marvel Zombies: The Book of Angels, Demons &amp; Various Monstrosities</a></li><li><a href=\"/marvel-spotlight-marvel-zombies/4050-32096/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-32096\">Marvel Spotlight Marvel Zombies</a></li><li><a href=\"/marvel-spotlight-marvel-zombies-return/4050-32097/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-32097\">Marvel Spotlight Marvel Zombies Return</a></li></ul>",

    "deck": "Following a catastrophic tragedy caused by superhumans, the US Government passes a Super-Human Registration Act that requires all super-powered individuals in the country to reveal their identities, disclose their powers and personal details, and register as government employees or risk indefinite incarceration. This causes a deep rift in the hero community, with some backing the Act while others oppose it.",
    "description": "<h2>Plot Summary</h2><p>After the super-villain <a href=\"/nitro/4005-3160/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3160\">Nitro</a> sets off an explosion in <a href=\"/stamford-ct/4020-45571/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-45571\">Stamford, CT</a>, killing the <a href=\"/new-warriors/4060-11896/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-11896\">New Warriors</a> and hundreds of innocents, the American Government, blaming the super-hero community for these deaths, enforces a <a href=\"/super-human-registration-act/4015-40639/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40639\">Super-Human Registration Act</a> that forces super-heroes to reveal their secret identities and work for the government, labeled as weapons of mass destruction. This doesn't sit well with some heroes and the Super-Hero community is divides into sides: <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man</a>'s Pro-Registration Act team enforced by <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> and its new director <a href=\"/maria-hill/4005-40824/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40824\">Maria Hill</a>, and Captain America's Anti-Registration Act team called the <a href=\"/secret-avengers/4060-40904/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40904\">Secret Avengers</a>. This separation causes a super-human Civil War that pits the two teams against each other physically and morally.</p><p>The Civil War has many consequences including the separation of the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a> and the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a>, the revelation of <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man's</a> secret identity to the world, the departure of the <a href=\"/thing/4005-2114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2114\">Thing</a> to France, the death of <a href=\"/goliath/4005-3470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3470\">Goliath</a> and finally the death of <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a> himself at the end of the War.</p><h2>Full Plot</h2><h3>Whose Side Are You On?</h3><p><a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Tony Stark</a> and <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Peter Parker</a> go to Washington D.C. to try to refute the Super-human Registration Act. Peter is to act as Tony's eyes and ears. However, things go awry and an assassination is plotted against Tony by <a href=\"/titanium-man/13823/\" data-ref-id=\"13823\">Titanium Man</a>. It is later revealed to the reader that Iron-Man (Tony Stark) planned the assassination in order to show the need for a Super-human Registration Act. When <a href=\"/captain-america/1442/\" data-ref-id=\"1442\">Captain America</a> is approached by <a href=\"/shield/3775/\" data-ref-id=\"3775\">SHIELD</a> to see if he could neutralize all of those against the Super-Human Registration Act, he refuses and has to run out after they try to shoot him down. Captain America is denounced as a criminal by the President, and he is ambushed by S.H.I.E.L.D, yet still escapes.</p><p>The <a href=\"/new-warriors/4060-11896/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-11896\">New Warriors</a>, a group of mutants with their own TV show, trying to get higher ratings ambush <a href=\"/nitro/3160/\" data-ref-id=\"3160\">Nitro</a>, <a href=\"/coldheart/4005-26244/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26244\">Coldheart</a>, <a href=\"/cobalt-man/4005-3286/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3286\">Cobalt Man</a>, and <a href=\"/speedfreek/4005-25735/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25735\">Speedfreek</a>. But Nitro, with powers amplified by <a href=\"/mutant-growth-hormone/4015-42280/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-42280\">Mutant Growth Hormone</a>, sets off an explosion, killing around 600-1200 people, at least 60 confirmed to be children. Of the super-human individuals involved in the incident only <a href=\"/robbie-baldwin/4005-2104/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2104\">Robbie Baldwin</a> and Nitro survived. <a href=\"/speedball/4005-2104/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2104\">Speedball</a> was rocketed from the incident, hanging on to life, and Nitro jumped into the back of a passing pickup truck and fled the scene. This horrific event rushes the Super-human Registration Act, and within a week it gets passed. Although it is not necessary for a superhuman to give away his secret identity to the public, he or she is required to register with S.H.I.E.L.D., giving away all personal information. In return, SHIELD will provide some sort of safe-haven, pay heroes a salary, and they will be scheduled holiday breaks. This is seen as a slap in the face to a large portion of heroes, being forced to choose between become a federal employee, or stop fighting crime. Others, such as Iron Man, see this just as an evolution of Super-humans' roles in society. As a sort of reward for his support of the act, Stark gives Spider-Man an new \"Iron Spider\" suit that will enhance Spider-Man's abilities with technology similar to Stark's own Iron man outfit.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/533/80016-158709-civil-war.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-80016\" data-ratio=\"1.5825\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:158.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/533/80016-158709-civil-war.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-80016\"><img alt=\"I am Peter Parker.\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/533/80016-158709-civil-war.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/533/80016-158709-civil-war.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>I am Peter Parker.</figcaption></figure><p>In a move that would shock the world, Spider-Man would demonstrate his support for both Iron-Man and the bill by coming out publicly in support of the Bill as Peter Parker and Spider-Man. In a shocking conclusion to the secret identity that Peter spent his entire adult life protecting he pulls off his mask in a news conference, saying \"I'm Peter Parker, and I've been Spider-Man since I was 15 years old. Any Questions?\" It is in this instant that Peter's life changed forever. Friends and enemies are hurt and shocked by the deception. Now knowing that his most hated enemy and one of his most faithful employees are one in the same <a href=\"/j-jonah-jameson/4005-1487/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1487\">J. Jonah Jameson</a> fires Parker and begins contemplating legal action he can take against Peter for fraud. Also enraged by the perceived betrayal, <a href=\"/doctor-octopus/4005-1485/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1485\">Doctor Octopus</a> attacks Peter outside of the high school at which he teaches. Other former villains also begin to launch attacks on Peter and those closest to him, making him realize one of the greatest fears he had of losing his secret identity. In order to protect those he loves <a href=\"/mary-jane/4005-13380/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13380\">Mary Jane</a> and <a href=\"/aunt-may/4005-1780/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1780\">Aunt May</a> are moved into <a href=\"/stark-tower/4020-40830/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40830\">Stark Tower</a> where they can receive 24 hour protection and monitoring.</p><p>Behind the scenes, the U.S. government is constructing a secret facility that will come to be known as the Negative Zone prison. Designated Facility 42, it is located in the Negative Zone, and will be accessible at first through a portal controlled by Stark, <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Mr. Fantastic</a>, and S.H.I.E.L.D. The prison was designed by Tony Stark, Reed Richards, and <a href=\"/hank-pym/4005-2247/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2247\">Hank Pym</a> with the intention of housing superpowered individuals that did not comply with the Superhuman Registration Act.

Other superheroes begin to band together with Captain America against the act including <a href=\"/luke-cage/4005-1450/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1450\">Luke Cage</a>, <a href=\"/iron-fist/4005-1492/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1492\">Iron Fist</a>, <a href=\"/goliath/4005-3470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3470\">Goliath</a>, <a href=\"/cloak/4005-1474/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1474\">Cloak</a>, <a href=\"/dagger/4005-1935/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1935\">Dagger</a>, the <a href=\"/young-avengers/4060-40426/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40426\">Young Avengers</a> and many others. The growing friction escalates until the first major battle between Iron Man's registration act support and Cap's \" <a href=\"/secret-avengers/4060-40904/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40904\">Secret Avengers</a>\". This battle involves all of the heroes associated with either side of the conflict, and comes to a climax with the unveiling of a cyborg version of <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a> (presumed to be the actual Thor at the time) as being in support of the Registration Act. The appearance of Thor surprises both sides of the conflict, as few knew of his existence before this point. The clone is much more violent than the real Thor and kills Bill Foster with a lightning blast through the chest. Horrified at what has happened, <a href=\"/invisible-woman/4005-2190/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2190\">Invisible Woman</a> creates a force field around the battered remainder of the resistance allowing Cloak to teleport the team to safety. After the battle Thor is revealed to be a cyborg rather than the original that was made by Iron Man and Reed Richards and that his violent behavior was an unintentional glitch in their work. This event move begins shaking the resolve of some pro-registration heroes such as Spider-Man and the Invisible Woman and causing anti-registration heroes Nighthawk and Stature to switch sides.</p><p>After the death of Bill Foster, the Civil War now spills into the personal lives of Susan Storm and Reed Richards and threatens their marriage by disagreement over the course of action which Reed and Tony have carelessly embarked upon. Offended and hurt when Reed says that he is doing what he is to protect Sue, she erects a cylindrical forcefield that comes crashing through the center of all 35 floors of the <a href=\"/baxter-building/4020-41454/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41454\">Baxter Building</a> and asks Reed if she looks like she needs protection. Unable to come to an agreement, Susan and <a href=\"/human-torch/4005-2120/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2120\">Human Torch</a> leave the Baxter building under the cover of night to join Captain America's underground resistance to the act. The <a href=\"/thing/4005-2114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2114\">Thing</a> also finds himself increasingly torn by the direction of the Civil War. He is watching those he loves and respects fight and take sides against each other. On one hand he is against the Superhuman Registration Act because he does not believe in what it stands for. On the other hand he believes himself to be a patriot, and as such does not believe that it is proper for him to be fighting his own government.</p><p>At this point the <a href=\"/thunderbolts/4060-23977/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-23977\">Thunderbolts</a> have already began a recruitment drive, attacking and capturing other former villains for the government to train and employ as a means to capture more of the renegade super-heroes and super-villians. The Super-Human Restraint Unit, a sub-division of <a href=\"/shield/3775/\" data-ref-id=\"3775\">SHIELD</a> also starts to neutralize mutants who still display their powers (e.g., stop crime) without registering with SHIELD. Individuals such as <a href=\"/prodigy/40475/\" data-ref-id=\"40475\">Prodigy</a> even get taken down by Iron Man himself.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1192246-ff538010_col.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1192246\" data-ratio=\"1.5189873417722\" data-width=\"474\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 474px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1192246-ff538010_col.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1192246\"><img alt=\"The Thing leaves\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px\" data-width=\"474\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1192246-ff538010_col.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1192246-ff538010_col.jpg 474w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Thing leaves\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1192246-ff538010_col.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1192246-ff538010_col.jpg 474w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px\" data-width=\"474\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Thing leaves</figcaption></figure><p>While transporting captured heroes to the containment facility Spider-Man finds himself uneasy when Iron Man asks him to remain at the head of the caravan of vehicles because of his ability to sense danger. Since he has never disclosed his Spider-Sense to Stark, Stark may have found out about his ability by using the suit to monitor him. A battle erupts when the Secret Avengers meet the caravan to release the captured members of the resistance. Using info from the Yancy Street Gang the anti-registration group tries to free captured heroes. Going after Captain America himself, Spider-Man finds himself in a fight he may not win. The two eventually stop fighting because Spider-Man cannot bring Captain America in himself even if he does win. Meanwhile, the Thing has been unintentionally drawn into the battle despite the Things insistence on remaining neutral. Both sides of the conflict mistake his intervention as acting on their behalf. After the battle the Thing angrily states that he cannot take any more of the fighting, and will be leaving for France. The government puts a hold on all of his finances and closely monitors him. Despite the unwanted attention, Ben Grim makes his way to France away from the conflict.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1192208-svsi.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1192208\" data-ratio=\"0.50471698113208\" data-width=\"848\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 848px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:50.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1192208-svsi.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1192208\"><img alt=\"Line 11-Peter v.s Tony Spider-man v.s Iron-man\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/64409/1192208-svsi.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1192208-svsi.jpg 848w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/64409/1192208-svsi.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Line 11-Peter v.s Tony Spider-man v.s Iron-man\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/64409/1192208-svsi.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1192208-svsi.jpg 848w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/64409/1192208-svsi.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Line 11-Peter v.s Tony Spider-man v.s Iron-man</figcaption></figure><p>Possibly because he trusted Peter more (or possibly to watch him turn) Tony Stark takes Peter Parker on a tour of the Negative Zone prison so that Peter can finally see more of the inner workings of the act. Peter's faith in the act had been shaky ever since first agreeing to assist Tony, however it is finally broken as he sees the inhuman conditions in which former allies and enemies are to be kept in the negative zone for their civil disobedience. Occupants are locked up in their cells, and many will never leave because of the escape threat they pose. Some are fully restrained to the point they cannot move their bodies at all and others yet are put in virtual reality goggles to immerse them in a fake world to pacify them. Before leaving Tony leaves Peter alone with Reed briefly. Unbeknownst to Peter, Tony is monitoring their entire conversation (presumably using the bugs designed into Peters suit) where Peter questions a nearly broken Reed Richards about what they have found themselves in. When he gets back to Stark Tower Peter rushes Aunt May and Mary Jane to grab what they can and flee Tony Stark's grasp. Tony crashes in through the wall of the building and begins a fight with Peter that would flow into the streets of New York. Tony incapacitates Peter with a fail-safe he built into Peter's suit. Peter is able to gain the upper hand by reversing the fail-safe (Peter being quite adept with computer technology had already secretly discovered the secret code in his new suit and hacked Tony's programming). Peter flees into the sewer and Stark unleashes several of Spider-Man's enemies in the Thunderbolts into the sewers to capture Peter.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/462/107586-132386-civil-war.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-107586\" data-ratio=\"1.5263157894737\" data-width=\"209\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 209px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/462/107586-132386-civil-war.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-107586\"><img alt=\"Punisher saved my life.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 209px) 100vw, 209px\" data-width=\"209\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/462/107586-132386-civil-war.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/462/107586-132386-civil-war.jpg 209w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Punisher saved my life.\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/462/107586-132386-civil-war.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/462/107586-132386-civil-war.jpg 209w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 209px) 100vw, 209px\" data-width=\"209\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Punisher saved my life.</figcaption></figure><p>Captured and beaten nearly to death, Peter is saved in the nick of time by the <a href=\"/punisher/4005-1525/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1525\">Punisher</a> who shoots and kills his attackers. Carrying Peter over his shoulder, the Punisher breaks into Captain America's secret hideout to get Peter medical attention. The Punisher did not have much patience for costumed superheroes before the Civil War, and probably would not have become involved had it not been for Stark's alliance with the Thunderbolts allowing costumed villains to become government sponsored bounty hunters. Captain America disagrees with Castle's involvement because of his track record, yet tentatively allows him to remain with the group. His tenure with the Secret Avengers is cut short when a pair of costumed villains come to the Secret Avengers hideout with offer of truce to join the cause. Castle automatically shoots and kills them in cold blood causing Captain America to give the Punisher a severe beating. Castle would not fight back due to his respect for Captain America (who as it turns out also played a role in training Castle's army regiment), and simply takes the attack.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1192256-hulkling_reveal.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1192256\" data-ratio=\"0.374\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:37.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1192256-hulkling_reveal.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1192256\"><img alt=\"Hulkling Disguise\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/64409/1192256-hulkling_reveal.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1192256-hulkling_reveal.jpg 500w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/64409/1192256-hulkling_reveal.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hulkling Disguise\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/64409/1192256-hulkling_reveal.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1192256-hulkling_reveal.jpg 500w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/64409/1192256-hulkling_reveal.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hulkling Disguise</figcaption></figure><p>Knowing that one of the members of the resistance is actually a double agent for Stark (specifically it is <a href=\"/tigra/4005-21188/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21188\">Tigra</a> that is double-crossing them), Captain America plans the most massive assault yet on the Registration Act. The plan is to infiltrate the Negative Zone prison and catch Stark off guard. What Tony does not know is that the morning of the attack Captain America sends <a href=\"/hulkling/4005-2259/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2259\">Hulkling</a> disguised as Hank Pym to incapacitate Pym and take his place. As one of the key members of Stark's group, Pym has full access to everything about the Negative Zone Prison. Teddy, disguised as Pym, infiltrates the Prison and releases all of the anti-registration heroes and villains that had been captured until this point. Tony along with the registered heroes attempts to head off the Secret Avengers only to discover that the fixed fight that he had prepared in order to put an end to the resistance was now evenly matched. Attempting to stop the fight from leaving the prison, prison officials attempt to close down the portals to the Positive Zone, stranding everyone in the Negative Zone until things are resolved and the Secret Avengers are captured. Not allowing this to happen, Cloak uses everything he has to teleport all of the heroes and villains involved in the conflict through the portal into the middle of the skies of New York.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/462/108526-84993-civil-war.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-108526\" data-ratio=\"1.5175\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/462/108526-84993-civil-war.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-108526\"><img alt=\"The last and final battle.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/462/108526-84993-civil-war.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/462/108526-84993-civil-war.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The last and final battle.\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/462/108526-84993-civil-war.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/462/108526-84993-civil-war.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The last and final battle.</figcaption></figure><p>Raining down from the skies, flying heroes are instructed to assist non-fliers to the ground regardless of their affiliation. Once mobile, both groups begin fighting again, and inadvertently begin destroying everything around them. At the climax of the battle Iron Man has Captain America in his sights, and is ready to take him out of the battle. As instructed by Captain America, the <a href=\"/young-avengers/4060-40426/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40426\">Young Avengers</a>'s <a href=\"/vision/4005-1504/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1504\">Vision</a> phases into Iron Man's armor and partially solidifies to take his weapons out of the equation. Caught off guard and with his heavy armor effectively useless, Captain America is able to gain the upper hand against Iron Man. Pummeling him with his fists and his shield, Captain America raises his shield over the smashed helmet of Iron Man. Looking through the pieces of his broken armor up at Captain America he simply challenges \"Do it.\" Before Captain America is able to bring his shield down upon Tony's face he is tackled by nearby government workers: police, firemen, and other emergency personnel. At first struggling against them, Steve Rogers stops and drops down. The battle around him begins to stop almost immediately. Rogers is horrified by the realization that he was no longer fighting for the people that he was sworn to protect. Looking at the carnage around him and seeing for the first time the true cost to everyone involved (civilian and super power alike), Captain America surrenders and tells his team to stand down. For better or for worse, Steve Rogers has single handedly ended the Civil War. While some heroes including Captain America are taken into custody following the final battle of the War, many escape including some key members of the Secret Avengers.</p><h3>Involvement in the Civil

Registration is required of all Mutants and other Super-Powered individuals. Anyone without powers that wishes to don a costume to fight crime is also required to register. Individuals that accept and register will effectively become government S.H.I.E.L.D.. Agents and will be trained by S.H.I.E.L.D. and are required to work for the government on government salary. Amnesty for past actions is also offered as an incentive to registrants.

In London, Weapon X (616's <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a>) and <a href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\">Jean Grey</a> track down the Human High Counsel, led by <a href=\"/bolivar-trask/4005-15923/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15923\">Bolivar</a> and <a href=\"/moira-mactaggert/4005-8304/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8304\">Moira</a> Trask ,to offer their help, using a mysterious package delivered by Sinister. Back at Xavier's Mansion, Rogue touches Bishop to look into his mind and the psychic backlash washes over her and Magneto, showing them glimpse of the real world and how everything should be. In the closing moments, Apocalypse notices Sinister is missing and Magneto calls a meeting for all of the X-Men and their associates while out in space the universe begins to crystallize.</p><h3>X-Men Chronicles</h3><p>The first issue shows Apocalypse's first attack on humanity and the first battle between Magneto's X-Men and Apocalypse's Horsemen ( <a href=\"/gideon/4005-2162/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2162\">Gideon</a>, <a href=\"/candra/4005-7900/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7900\">Candra</a>, <a href=\"/war/4005-73720/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-73720\">War</a>, <a href=\"/death/4005-12620/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12620\">Death</a>, and <a href=\"/sabretooth/4005-4563/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4563\">Sabretooth</a>). In battle Sabretooth hesitated and he is left behind. Meanwhile back at Wundagore Mountain ,the X-Men's base of operations, <a href=\"/scarlet-witch/4005-1466/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\">Scarlet Witch</a> and Rogue defend the base and the younger mutant children against <a href=\"/nemesis/4005-9367/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9367\">Nemesis</a> (Apocalypse's chosen son). The X-Men are successful in thwarting Apocalypse's attack on both fronts but at the cost of the life of the Scarlet Witch.</p><p>The second issue opens with Weapon X and Jean Grey leaving the team following him rescuing her from Sinister's genetic holding pens. Gambit and Rogue begin a romantic relationship but when <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-76835/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-76835\">Wolverine</a> attacks at Holocaust's (formerly Nemesis until his skin was all blown away) behest ,Rogue is forced to make a choice of saving Gambit or Magneto. She chooses Magneto and Gambit is buried under a falling wall. He survives and the battle is won but at the end he leaves the team.</p><h3>Astonishing X-Men</h3><p>Magneto tells all his X-Men what he saw in Bishop's head. Then <a href=\"/blink/4005-12548/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12548\">Blink</a> arrives through a portal and is followed by a blazing out of control <a href=\"/sunfire/4005-3175/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3175\">Sunfire</a> and it takes the combined powers of Magneto, <a href=\"/storm/4005-1444/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1444\">Storm</a> and <a href=\"/iceman/4005-1464/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1464\">Iceman</a> to calm him down. They are followed by one of Apocalypse's Prelates, but Blink closes the portal on him killing him. Later, Rogue is preparing to leave and Gambit tries to talk to her down, and as he tries to kiss her they are interrupted by Blink carrying baby Charles. <a href=\"/nightcrawler/4005-1461/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1461\">Nightcrawler</a> and Magneto discuss the various missions that have been assigned. <a href=\"/quicksilver/4005-1467/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1467\">Quicksilver</a> tries to stop Rogue from going to no avail while <a href=\"/morph/4005-12547/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12547\">Morph</a> make jokes and then everyone departs.</p><p>A team of X-Men (Rogue, Sunfire, Blink, Morph, Sabretooth, and <a href=\"/wild-child/4005-9476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9476\">Wild Child</a>) are sent to Chicago to stop Apocalypse's cullings. Sunfire freaks out as he remembers the killing that he lived through, and Rogue is forced to take his powers to calm him down. At the Mansion, Magneto is holding his sleeping son while Bishop berates him for his less-then-aggressive strategy. He tells Bishop he just wants tonight with his son. Meanwhile, Apocalypse has finally found Magneto's base and plans to handle the matter personally. Back in the battle, Sabretooth has Blink teleport him and Wild Child directly to Holocaust, against her own better judgement and Rogue's fervent wishes. After a brutal battle, Sabretooth finally cracks Holocaust's armor and watches the villain dissipate. However, after Sabretooth falls unconscious due to his own injuries, Holocaust rematerialized in his armor.</p><p>Wild Child flees the Infinities only to run into Holocaust. Holocaust picks up Wild Child and then reveals himself to actually be Morph just seconds before Sunfire fries them. Rogue and Blink arrive through a portal and Wild Child (since he cant speak) licks Rogue to give her his memories of what has occurred. Meanwhile the real Holocaust is holding a badly beaten Sabretooth over a cliff overlooking a new Infinities processing plant. He gloats about Apocalypse's new army before knocking Sabretooth unconscious again where Creed dreams of the night he and Logan (Weapon X) were on a mission and he saved a young Blink from being killed. As Sunfire flies the rest of the team to Creed's location, Morph continues to crack jokes and sing despite protest from Sunfire. Back at the Mansion, Bishop and Magneto have a tense conversation when Nanny comes in with Charles. The robot then senses major danger and wraps itself around the baby and disappears into the floor (Magneto explains that's her programming to protect Charles). At the Infinities plant, Holocaust is watching as thousands of Infinite soldiers are pumped out of the factory , when all of a sudden a large hump back whale becomes marooned on the plant floor. The whale reveals itself to be Morph and has the entire team hiding inside his mouth. They defeat the Infinities and go searching for Sabretooth. Blink cries out and teleports to him when she sees him tied up to a pole and bleeding.</p><p>Blink confronts Holocaust directly and after a brief but intense battle she teleports him over a vat of acid and drops him in. In another part of the facility Rogue and the rest of the team are fighting against hopeless odds, with an army of Infinities. Meanwhile Magneto is a captive of Apocalypse (see Amazing X-Men) and is being made to watch his wife's team fight their losing battle. Apocalypse continues to taunt the restrained Magneto until he knocks him out. Back at the plant, Wild Child and Sunfire free the humans being held captive while Morph goes after Blink. He finds her and as the two escape, Holocaust punches through the side of the acid vat and attacks them both. Suddenly \"Morph\" reveals himself as Rogue and uses her own powers to crack Holocaust armor again just as the real Morph jumps through the roof and becomes a large brick that crashes down on Holocaust. Rogue then lunges at him but he sends her flying leaving a ditch in the ground as she slides. While the rest of the team attacks Holocaust, Morph goes after Rogue, changing into her baby to get her attention. Holocaust then taunts about how Apocalypse found and destroyed the Mansion that the X-Men were in. This gives Rogue all the fury she needs as she pounds on him, landing both of them on a teleporter. Iceman grabs her just as he is about to teleport them both to Apocalypse's stronghold. With Creed saved and the team together again they vow to go after Apocalypse and end his reign.</p><h3>X-Calibre</h3><p>The young mutant <a href=\"/switchback/4005-41011/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41011\">Switchback</a> takes a gondola ride down a river cavern where she is left alone. Thinking shes been taken advantage of she is approached by a huge man who tells her that there are \"no charlatans here\". His name is Cain and he is there to lead her to <a href=\"/avalon/4020-55758/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55758\">Avalon</a>. They travel through freezing jungle (which she doesnt notice getting less and less frozen as she goes) then after several days they come upon the paradise of Avalon (616's Savage Land). Back in what was once Manhattan, Nightcrawler is lurking in Angel's private quarters at \"Heaven\" nightclub to get information on his travel plans to Avalon so he can locate the precog <a href=\"/destiny/4005-3557/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3557\">Destiny</a> for Magneto. Angel balks at being used by him, Gambit and Magneto for illicit activities but gives him the information anyway, telling him to go to the east river and ask for <a href=\"/warpath/4005-2158/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2158\">Proudstar</a>.At the Xavier Mansion, Magneto orders <a href=\"/mystique/4005-1469/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1469\">Mystique t</a>o assist her son, Nightcrawler, in reaching Avalon and assist him in extracting Destiny from there. At the warehouse by the east river, Nightcrawler meets Proudstar and his tribe \"the Ghost Dance\" which is the first step on the trek to Avalon, called \"the Infernal Gallop\". When Proudstar accuses Mystique of pillaging the people she ferries to Avalon before delivering them, Nightcrawler grabs his finger and teleports it off his hand. In the background, a young woman sneaks away to Apocalypse's citadel, frying the brain of a guard with a psychic arrow on the way there. The young woman, <a href=\"/moonstar/4005-1463/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1463\">Danielle Moonstar</a>, approaches Apocalypse and one of his puppets, <a href=\"/deadpool/4005-7606/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7606\">Dead Man Wade</a>, to tell him of Nightcrawler's trek to Avalon. Apocalypse call for <a href=\"/damask/4005-14848/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14848\">Damask</a> and tell her to take these two, collectively the Pale Riders, and find Avalon and burn it to the ground. Nightcrawler is on a cramped barge with other refugees, while down in Avalon Switchback has arrived an is brought by Cain to meet Destiny. As their fingers touch, Destiny has a painful precognitive flash of Avalon burning and Apocalypse coming.</p><p>As Destiny collapses from the shock of her vision Switchback, Cain, and Destiny's adopted son <a href=\"/cypher/4005-14559/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14559\">Doug Ramsey</a> rush to her side as she screams about Avalon burning. By the east river, Apocalypse's Infinities attack Proudstar's Ghost Dance and despite their best efforts are summarily dispatched. Menawhile on the submarine bound for Avalon, the air conditioning unit has busted and Nightcrawler and the other passengers are choking on their own exhalations. The captain surfaces rather then have everyone perish but warns that the instrumentation is broken and they may not be beyond American Detection Range. When they break the surface the crew realizes that the cargo bay doors are electronically sealed and everyone may have already suffocated to death. They signal a nearby ship who happen to have a torch to cut through the doors and save at least some of the people inside. The new ship's captain, <a href=\"/callisto/4005-3423/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3423\">Callisto</a>, offers her own ship to finish the submarine's trip to Avalon. Nightcrawler is on the roof of the sub, having teleported out (barely) when the ship broke air. Above on the Pale Riders' ship, <a href=\"/damask/4005-14848/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14848\">Damask</a> is watching these events unfold while Moonstar is repeatedly cutting Wade and watching his healing factor work. Damask receives a transmission from Apocalypse informing her that he is sending a secondary expedition and that when they arrive in Avalon she is to \"kill Avalon\". In frustration, she kills Moonstar and tells Wade \"And I loved it\". Back on the ship, Callisto has taken hold of the refugees to Avalon and they head on their way. She and her crew collect all valuables that the refugees have on them and then when they get to deeper water she orders the cargo doors in the water, dumping every passenger into the freezing cold ocean killing them. The bodies pile up the boat drifts in what is called an Atrocity Zone, small islands in the Atlantic where Apocalypse dumped all the corpses he was creating. Callisto shoots the crewman responsible for letting them drift in to it and tells the rest of the crew to wait for her signal. Unbeknown to Callisto, Nightcrawler has been teleporting around the ship taking out her crew one by one and he then appears on the deck and takes out the remainder of the crew. Callisto is about to shoot Nightcrawler when Mystique shows up and points a gun at her head.</p><p>Callisto is dead and Mystique and Nightcrawler, mother and son, are having a family reunion. They jump onto the ladder up to Mystique's helicopter and when Nightcrawler asks how she found him, she tells him that she was actually looking for the pirates because they'd killed the last two groups of travelers. On the Pale Riders ship, Wade is still devestated about Moonstar's death and Damask tell him that Moonstar never liked him anyway. Nightcrawler and Mystique arrive at Mystique's Antarctic headquarters and Kurt asks his mother why she won't go to Avalon. When she evades the topic he slaps her and accuses her of everything he had heard about her from the Ghost Dance. She admits that she takes the possessions of her passengers, calls it a tariff, and Nightcrawler tells her she isnt worthy of being in Avalon. Later, they are rowing down the underground river to Avalon and they meet Cain. Mystique asks where Destiny is and when he says she's too old to greet people anymore so he does it. The three of them trek to Avalon, with Cain carrying all the crates they brought and when they reach the edge of the paradise Mystique, who has never actually the end of the journey, is breathless over the beauty of Avalon and of the news the Destiny has a son. As they approach Destiny, Irene is thrilled to see Raven and hopeful that this means she will stay with them. When Mystique says she came to take her back with them, Destiny silently turns and leads them to Avalon Village. She introduced them to Switchback and tells of her vision that they will all die . Meanwhile at the entrance of Avalon, Wade is ready to kill everything as per his order while Damask on the other hand is so taken aback by the beauty she sees and is having seconds thoughts about her orders. In Avalon Village, Mystique and Nightcrawler are telling Destiny about Bishop, Xavier, and the alternate timeline. Destiny is hesitant to leave, claiming that her departure might cause Avalon to be destroyed and telling them that she has much to lose, such as her son. Suddenly a rocket blows up their tent and everyone scrambles to see what happened. Nightcrawler tries to get Cain to fight to protect them but he has a crisis of conscious so severe (his violent nature fighting his fanatical pacifist nature) that it caused an anuerism, killing him. Mystique and Co break out their guns, while on a hill Wade is continuing to shot at them. He asks Damask why she isnt killing anyone and she changes sides, stabbing Wade. This stalls his just long enough for Nightcrawler to teleport his head off his body. Damask tells him that if he wants her help shes willing and together with Mystique and Switchback they stand ready for Apocalypse's invasion.</p><p>While still standing over Wade's dead body, Switchback suddenly changes positions explaining that its her mutant power to shift herself back down her own timeline a max of 10 seconds, in this case to fix the headache she was getting. Mystique and Switchback head back to the village while Nightcrawler interrogates Damask about Apocalypse's next wave. She tells him she doesn't know as she learns in and rubs his face fur commenting it feels like velvet. Back in the village, everything is on fire and everyone is in pain. They find Destiny and Doug helping other people and Doug and Mystique get into a fight over Doug's mutant status (his translation field covers the area so everyone can communicatie) and how his mother could ever be friends with someone like Mystique. Switchback jumps in and says that all they want is for her to come to America and confirm or deny what Bishop is saying. Suddenly one of the villagers with bio-electric powers goes berzerk killing several others. Before Mystique can kill her, Doug stops her and says that he can read background noise in thoughts and that she has two. At this point, Shadow King reveals him as possessing the girl explaining that he came in with Wade and when he was killed jumped to Switchback (which explained her headache). Mystique shoves Doug out of the way and blasts the possessed girl. Damask tells them that all they did was kill his host and he'll have a new one by now. Nightcrawler asks how does his power work and she explains that he traveling from mind to mind through an adjacent dimension. Destiny stumbles through the carnage and Shadow King approaches her in the guise of a pyrotic mutant named Marcus and berates her life's work as a waste of time. Damask lashes out with her own power, searing psychic knives, which forces Shadow King out of the boy. The boy is released as Doug accuses Nightcrawler and Mystique of causing all the carnage to which he replies that it was inevitable andall they did was move it up the schedule. Suddenly, Mystique is possessed by Shadow King and begins cycling through forms until she stops on Sabretooth, because it was the worst memory he could find in her mind. Using a combination of their powers, Nightcrawler teleports while Switchback uses her power to extend their time between worlds (where they find Shadow King) and Damask destroys his mind with her psychic knives. With his last vestige of power he makes a nearby mutant blast Destiny but Doug jumps in the way and saves her, dying in the process. Destiny agrees to accompany Nightcrawler back to Magneto and help bring down Apocalypse.</p><h3>Gambit &amp; the X-Ternals</h3><p><a href=\"/jubilee/4005-4562/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4562\">Jubilee</a> is fleeing from Infinite soldier while carrying stolen medical supplies and as she falls Guido comes barreling through a wall and Sunspot blasts them. Jubilee is gathering up her bundles when Sunspot explodes another grunt above her. When Guido tries to check on her she just yells that shes fine and wasnt scared. The trio sneaks through the city to a human safehouses where they deliver the medical supplies under the watchful eye of the teams human member, Lila Cheney. She tells them that Gambit just got back but wont tell them where hes been. They walk through the underground tunnels (where legend tell of a tribe of mutants that once lived there) they that serve as their base until they come upon Magneto. They almost attack him but Gambit stops them and tell them that they came together and that Magneto needs their help stealing something BIG. At the headquarters of the Madri, a priesthood devoted to Apocalypse, Rictor berates his lackeys for not capturing the X-ternals and helping him get promoted. While the team walks through the tunnels, Guido and Jubilee discuss (sorta) Lila and Remy's dating again while Gambit and Erik have tense conversation about Rogue. Magneto leads them to a hidden chamber in the tunnel dubbed \"the Science Chamber\" and when they question Magneto's motives he tells them he got his information from Apocalypse's scientific librarian for cataloging and the information is guaranteed. He mentions that she didnt complain about his methods and reasons when he rescued her from an asylum but she says it was a long time ago. The doors open to a room full of scientific wonder jsut before the Madri teleport in. The X-ternals and Magneto dispatch the invaders while Sunspot locates Peter Corbeau the \"librarian\". Peter warns that if the Madri came the other will come and they dont have time. He pulls up information about the Shi'ar galaxy (which Magneto had asked him to find) on the rooms computers, which are composed of the remains of Apocalypse Celestial ship that Magneto downs years earlier. When Lila balks at the idea of going to outer space, Magneto informs her that she is a latent mutant and that her long range teleportation powers will be responsible for taking them. Using the chamber's cybernetic helmet, Corbeau helps Lila visualize the far off galaxy and open her mind to her own powers. As her power floods through her, Rictor and the Madri arrive and Magneto tells them to go while he fights them off. Lila opens a vortex that takes all the X-ternals through it and at the last possible second Rictor jumps through. Magneto defeats the rest of the soldiers and Peter(knowing Apocalypse will have him killed for this, sets the self destruct program.</p><p>The team arrives a moment later on the Shi 'ar homeworld and are immediately confronted by the Shi'ar Imperial Guard. Guido catches Lila as she falls from the sky, dropping Jubilee in the process. Rictor instantly surrenders but Gambit and the team turn and run which only incites the Imperial Guard to pursue them. After a brief battle they are able to escape into the cover of the forest. However, once they enter the forest, the forest trees begin to attack them and suck them down into the ground. Moments later the Guard with Rictor in tow come by and find no sign of them at all. Underground, the X-ternals see a speak to the shadowy figure who had the sentient plants abduct them and Lila says she felt the entire planet call her here through the portal. Rictor tells the Imperials that he has a tracker on one of the other mutants and as Oracle tries to read his mind there is a sort of feedback where she says that for a brief moment everything ceased to exist. She says that the telepathic spies were right and Emperor D'Ken's meddling of the M'Kraan crystal will destroy everything. Rictor offers to help provided he can have the X-ternals when they are finished. In the underground cavern, everyone also felt the nexus expansion effect. The leader, Jonah, recounts the story of how D'Ken came to power by murdering his father and Lilandra and wresting the throne from Deathbird. After becoming emperor, D'Ken discovered the M'Kraan crystal which was now radiating out energies that were threatening the entire universe. He tells them that the blink they felt means that this sector of space is next to be nullified. Even with Jonah's assurance that they will be spared so as to see \"the end of all that is\" so they can stop it from happening again, Jubilee still freaks out saying that they were just supposed to steal a rock, which Sunspot agrees with. Just as Jonah is rallying them to the cause, Rictor and the Imperial Guard burst in through the ceiling. As they groups battle another blink happens and everything starts to crystalize around them. At the last moment before they are turned to crystal, the X-ternals are teleported to a ship where they are face to face with the Deathbird and the Starjammers</p><p>The Starjammers ship drops out of hyper speed just outside the energy absorption system that surrounds the M'Kraan planet. When Gambit reconsiders the plan, Deathbird reminds him that he traveled across the universe for this. The Starjammers plan to keep the armada busy while the X-Ternals teleport planet-side. When they reach the surface they are instantly attacked by Shi'ar guards and Bobby tells them they don't have to beat the army; they simply have to delay them while Gambit and Lila get the jewel. Meanwhile, Gambit, Lila, and Deathbird approach the crystal (which Gambit didn't expect to be 3 stories high) and Deathbird tells them that as much power is in a sliver as in the whole crystal. As more soldiers approach them, Lila is grabbed by a strange hand and pulled inside the crystal. Gambit and Deathbird follow her and meet Jahf, the guardian of the M'Kraan. Outside, Guido, Sunspot and Jubilee continue fighting and after the next blink Sunspots hands turn white with energy. Suddenly Gladiator flies in with Rictor in tow, with soldiers still surrounding them the situation seems more and more hopeless. Inside the crystal Gambit, Deathbird and Jahf approach the center of the crystal where Lila and D'Ken stand transfixed by the glowing energy ball. When Deathbird attempts to attack Jahf she is mesmerized also. Jahf explains to Gambit how the crystal is the nexus of all realities (even mentioning the X-men who came through there back in the 70's). He tells Remy that Bishop is telling the truth about the world being wrong and how it was affecting every reality. Jahf tells him to take a shard of the crystal and use it to send Bishop tot the past and fix everything. Outside while Gladiator and Sunspot fight, there's another blink but this time Sunspot's entire body glows bright white and everyone except Rictor and the X-ternals are turned to crystal. Everyone leaps into the crystal as Gambit prepares to smash the energy matrix. As he hits the glowing ball, everything explodes and Sunspot absorbs more energy then ever before. He is left behind as Lila teleports them home.</p><p>Dazzler and Exodus search the Morlock tunnels beneath the mansion and find the ruined remains of Nanny but no sign of baby Charles. At Apocalypse's citadel, Rictor is being questioned by Apocalypse regarding the events with the X-Ternals. He recounts chasing Remy and Lila through the tunnel (with Guido and Jubilee heading in a different direction with the crystal shard towards Magneto). Though exhausted, Lila runs towards daylight while Rictor follows behind then taunting. Back at Rictor's interrogation, Apocalypse informs him that he was wrong to think that Gambit was more important than the crystal shard Jubilee carried, while he stroked the head of Magneto's son. Meanwhile in the tunnel, Jubilee is running with the crystal and baby Charles from Guido, who it turns out was a spy on their team. He tells her that two months earlier he was captured and has hated Gambit ever since. Guido agreed to spy on them and keep the rest of them safe. Apocalypse wants Gambit and Rogue to get to Magneto, but the plan went awry when they run into the robot which lead them to the mansion instead of Apocalypse as planned. Gambit destroys the robot.</p><h2>Lasting Effects</h2><p>Though this reality was supposed to have vanished when all was said and done, further issues have come out to show that this alternate reality still thrives. In addition, Bishop lived through both realities. But, since the AoA was never to have happened, his body reverted to what it was before the event but his mind kept the memories.</p><p>A few characters from the Age of Apocalypse made their way to Earth-616 before the reality was to disappear:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/x-man/4005-15051/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15051\">X-Man</a> - The reality's version of <a href=\"/cable/4005-2157/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2157\">Cable</a> created by Mr. Sinister using the genetic material from Cyclops and Jean Grey.

However, Apocalypse wasn't shown to control this reality. In this alternate reality, Magneto gathered all mutants to fight against humanity after Xavier was dead. In the two-part episode, \"One Man's Worth,\" a temporal anomaly caused Xavier to disappear and altered the reality. Bishop and his sister, Shard, learns that Fitzroy, the time-traveling mutant, had killed young Xavier in the past. Since Xavier was killed, his dreams of human and mutant coexistence had no meaning and thus the two races are having a war against each other. To prevent his death, Bishop and Shard convinces Wolverine and Storm's alternate selves to go with them and stop Fitzroy from killing young Xavier.</p><h3>Wolverine and the X-Men</h3><p>After the X-Men accomplish their mission in the present to avoid a world ruled by Sentinels, a variant of the Age of Apocalypse reality is shown in the final episode.

While the location of this planet is not known exactly, <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\"> Doctor Doom</a> believes that it is in orbit of a star that is the last star of the galaxy that they are in. There is immediate turmoil among the villains as they begin to fight with one another. <a href=\"/ultron/4005-2242/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2242\"> Ultron</a> makes a first strike against <a href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\"> Galactus</a> and is drained of all his energy for his trouble. The <a href=\"/beyonder/4005-10300/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10300\"> Beyonder</a> then tells them to fight and that the victorious group shall be granted all that they desire. <a href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\"> Galactus</a> and <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\"> Doctor Doom</a> immediately attempt an attack on the <a href=\"/beyonder/4005-10300/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10300\"> Beyonder</a> in an attempt to seize his power for their own, but they are swatted away like flies. The heroes are in awe, having witnessed this display of power and realizing how easily he defeated two of their greatest enemies.</p><p>The two groups are then transported to the planet surface with the exception of <a href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\"> Galactus</a> and <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\"> Doctor Doom</a> who land there after being knocked back by the <a href=\"/beyonder/4005-10300/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10300\"> Beyonder</a>. The heroes immediately attempt to attack <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\"> Magneto</a>, but rather than fight, he repels himself into the sky by riding the magnetic waves of the planet. <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\"> Doctor Doom</a> finds a fortress and hopes to rally the villains to stand against the <a href=\"/beyonder/4005-10300/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10300\"> Beyonder</a>, but they rebel against his plan and so he sets out to obtain the <a href=\"/beyonder/4005-10300/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10300\"> Beyonder</a>'s power for his own. <a href=\"/kang/4005-2264/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2264\"> Kang</a> witnesses <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\"> Doctor Doom</a> attempt to leave and uses weaponry available in the fortress to blast <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\"> Doctor Doom</a> out of the sky. Doom conveniently crashes near the heroes, followed shortly by the group of angered villains and the first battle of the series ensues.</p><p> </p><p><b>Prisoners of War</b></p><p>As his allies do battle with the heroes, Doom attempts to take council with Galactus, but is ignored. He then goes back to the fortress to see what kind of technology has been provided for the Beyonder's victims to use in the war game. He makes quick work of the fortress' defense systems and discovers an inert <a href=\"/ultron/4005-2242/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2242\"> Ultron</a>. Meanwhile, the heroes defeat several of the villains, and the remnants flee from the battle. In need of a place to detain the captured villains, the heroes discover that a fortress has been provided for them as well. Rather than press their advantage, they decide to regroup and prepare for a long series of battles by learning about their new, temporary headquarters. Magneto finds yet a third fortress, located hundreds of miles away from the other two and plans his next move as well.</p><p>The villains return to their fortress only to be assaulted by Doctor Doom and a rebuilt Ultron that now serves him. Under their combined might, the remaining villains are subjugated and agree to obey Doom's leadership. Meanwhile, the heroes attack Magneto at yet the power plant and Wasp is captured by Magneto during his retreat. During the confrontation, Thing discovers that he is able to revert to his human form.</p><p> </p><p><b>Tempest Without, Crisis Within</b></p><p>Magneto takes Wasp back to his fortress and the two are trapped there as the weather in his section of the world changes and prevents them from leaving. Spider-Man overhears Charles Xavier (now able to walk) and the X-Men planning to leave the heroes and join with Magneto and attempts to intervene and stop them. Spider-Man attempts to report the activities of the X-Men to the Avengers, but has his memory altered by Xavier before he can do so.</p><p>Doctor Doom suggests an alliance with Magneto, but is turned down. Magneto then returns to Wasp and the two share a moment while the storm rages outside. At Doombase, Doctor Doom begins experimenting on Skeeter (who was not previously mentioned in the series) and grants her new powers. With her new powers, she chooses a new name and becomes Titania. The second subject that Doom experiments on is granted the power to project plasma and chooses the name Volcana.</p><p>Thor frees Enchantress and the two depart to have a moment away from the mortals. At dawn, Doom leads an assault against the heroes' base with the remaining villains and manages to catch the heroes off guard. Using their advantage, they force the heroes to regroup while the prisoners are freed. The heroes' base is destroyed but the villains discover that the heroes managed to escape while checking the wreckage.</p><p> </p><p><b>Situation: Hopeless</b></p><p>The villains quickly spot the fleeing group and use their combined might to throw a mountain on the heroes. Thor and Enchantress are interrupted by the concussion of the falling mountain and return to the ruins of the heroes' base only to appear in the middle of the villains. Thor takes on the villains single-handedly but is defeated and vanishes, leaving only his helmet. Doom then orders Ultron to kill Kang for his earlier attempt to take Doom's life.</p><p>The X-Men arrive at Magneto's stronghold and form an alliance with their former enemy. Magneto then reveals that he believes the heroes should take an aggressive role and do as the Beyonder requests: kill the villains and claim the prize. Wasp then compares him to Hitler and flees from the base. Meanwhile, the heroes are revealed to have survived the mountain toss, as Hulk caught it on his back and prevented it from crushing the group. Iron Man's armour was damaged, and with Hulk only able to hold the mountain up, they are effectively trapped. Mr. Fantastic then uses Hawkeye's arrows and Spider-Man's web shooters to repair Iron Man's armour and he blasts an escape path through the mountain. As they exit, Thor returns to the group, explaining that he hid his escape with a flash of lightning. The heroes then regroup to a village that was brought to the planet, but are concerned with Galactus who is standing on top of a nearby mountain.</p><p> </p><p><b>The Battle of the Four Armies</b></p><p>Galactus then moves, and summons his ship to the planet. Seeing the ship in the sky, Magneto and the X-Men leap begin making their way to Galactus. Also seeing the ship, Doom begins preparing the villains for battle as well. Charles Xavier and Magneto attempt a combined psychic attack on Galactus while Mr. Fantastic attempts to distract him. Galactus unleashes a robot from his ship to fight Captain America's faction while repelling the psychic attack. The America faction defeats the robot, but not without leaving several members of the team incapacitated. It is then that the Doom faction steps in and attacks the heroes. The heroes are hard pressed, and in danger of being defeated when Magneto and the X-Men arrive. While Galactus is distracted by the battle at his feet, Doom sneaks on board Galactus' ship. Eventually the Doom faction is driven back, but Colossus is gravely wounded. Magneto and the X-Men depart, leaving Colossus behind (not without protest of several of the X-Men). Galactus continues to construct his world devouring machine, unhindered.</p><p> </p><p><b>A Little Death...</b></p><p>Wasp begins making her way back to the America faction. Doom, exploring Galactus' ship, discovers Klaw, the self-styled master of sound. With new orders from Doom, Klaw returns to the villains. Xavier takes a moment to rest his legs while the X-Men survey the damage done to their base by Galactus' psychic attack. While resting, Xavier stretches out with his mind and touches the minds of the villains, ascertaining their new plan. He then orders the X-Men into action. Storm, unhappy with Xavier's new direct leadership role, confronts him. Xavier then tells her that he would go so far as to alter the memories of the X-Men to prevent insubordination. Meanwhile, Colossus begins to show interest in an alien woman named Zsaji but she is whisked away by the Human Torch. The villains arrive at a volcano and begin setting Doom's plan into motion but are attacked by the remaining X-Men. During the fight Molecule Man is seriously injured by Wolverine and the villains flee. Cyclops, realizing that their plan was most likely to harm Galactus, fires his optic beam into a region of volcanoes, igniting them. In an unexpected turn, Wasp is then shot and killed by Wrecker as the villains make their way back to Doombase.</p><p> </p><p><b>Berserker</b></p><p>Spider-Woman joins Captain America's faction, having been uprooted from earth during the construction of the planet. The Wrecking Crew tosses Wasp's body into the village as they continue towards Doombase. Zsaji, the healer, attempts to help Wasp but it is too late. While the Avengers try to decide their next course of action, the X-Men continue to pursue the fleeing villains.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/new-avengers-illuminati/4050-33054/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-33054\">New Avengers: Illuminati</a></li><li><a href=\"/secret-wars-omnibus/4050-28160/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-28160\"> Secret Wars Omnibus</a></li><li><a href=\"/she-hulk-superhuman-law/4050-27491/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-27491\"> She-Hulk: Superhuman Law</a></li><li><a href=\"/spider-man-and-the-secret-wars/4050-34180/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-34180\"> Spider-Man and the Secret Wars</a></li><li><a href=\"/thing-classic-volume-one/4000-270054/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-270054\">Thing Classic</a></li><li><a href=\"/what-if-secret-wars/4050-28948/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-28948\"> What If?

    "description": "<h2>A Son's Revenge</h2><p>David Haller ( <a href=\"/legion/4005-13349/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13349\">Legion</a>), son of Charles Xavier ( <a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Professor X</a>) and Israeli diplomat <a href=\"/gabrielle-haller/4005-15049/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15049\">Gabrielle Haller</a>, had spent many years of his schizophrenic life in a coma following a battle between the <a href=\"/shadow-king/4005-14889/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14889\">Shadow King</a> (who had possessed David) and the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a>. Suddenly, in a response to the presence of <a href=\"/mystique/4005-1469/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1469\">Mystique</a>, David awakes, his fractured mind healed into one single personality with one single goal -- to help his father achieve his goals of peaceful coexistence between humans and mutants. David targets Erik Lehnsherr ( <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto</a>) as the true adversary to Xavier achieving his dream. His solution is to travel back in time approximately 20 years and murder Magneto before he adopts his anti-human policies and becomes Professor X's enemy.</p><h2>Battle For The Past</h2><p>A team of X-Men, consisting of <a href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\">Jean Grey</a>, <a href=\"/storm/4005-1444/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1444\">Storm</a>, <a href=\"/iceman/4005-1464/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1464\">Iceman</a>, <a href=\"/bishop/4005-1503/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1503\">Bishop</a>, and <a href=\"/psylocke/4005-3176/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3176\">Psylocke</a>, arrive in Israel in order to stop Legion, who has destroyed everything the Israeli army has thrown at him. In the ensuing battle, Storm realizes Legion's plan, but only after Bishop is knocked unconscious attempting to absorb some of Legion's powers. Storm orders Psylocke to mind-link to Bishop, who still possesses some of Legion's chronal energy, causing the X-Men (with the exception of Jean Grey, who had telekinetically anchored herself) to teleport along with Legion. Before she passes out, though, Jean is able to contact Professor X and the rest of the X-Men in order to alert them to Legion's plan.</p><h2>Back In Time</h2><p>The four X-Men and Legion arrive safely in the past, though the time travel erases all five of the mutants' memories. Legion arrives at the hospital at which both Xavier and Magneto, both young and friends, work. Following a touch from Magneto, Legion experiences a psychic backlash that causes him to project visions of Magneto's past. Magneto gets angry and storms out and Legion apologizes, but this energy starts to awaken Legion's memory. In the present, Jean Grey, Professor X, and <a href=\"/cable/4005-2157/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2157\">Cable</a> pool their energies and send Cable back in time to alert the four time-stranded X-Men, who had got jobs working at the docks. Cable appears to them and, although they don't recognize him, Bishop thinks he looks familiar and touches him, causing the temporal energy surrounding Cable to reach the others, awakening their memories as well.</p><h2>Battle For The Future</h2><p>Legion, disguised as his father, Xavier, appears to Gabrielle Haller at the hospital. He seduces her. At the docks, Xavier gets a psychic warning, alerting him that something is wrong with Gabrielle. With Magneto in tow, he runs to the hospital to find Gabrielle disheveled, on the floor, clothes torn. Suddenly, Legion appears behind the two men and threatens Magneto. The X-Men, memories restored, quickly rush to the scene of the fight, only to find Magneto and Legion locked in battle high above in the sky. Bishop and Iceman work on controlling the damage, while Storm and Psylocke attempts to find Xavier. Iceman, who finds himself much more powerful tries to defeat Legion, but to no avail. Legion grabs the defeated Magneto and starts to deliver his murderous blow, but at the last moment, Xavier throws himself in the way of the blast, getting killed instantly, but saving the life of his friend in the process. With Xavier's death, Legion and the X-Men disappear. Only Bishop remained, due to the fact that he was a time traveler and, therefore, a chronal anomaly in the first place. Magneto, defeated but alive, is left to cradle the lifeless body of his friend, Charles Xavier.</p><h2>Effects</h2><p>With Xavier out of the picture, the <a href=\"/\">Age of Apocalypse</a> is ushered in and dominates the X-books for four months.</p><h2>Associated Issues</h2><p>Though it is not a part of the official canon of Legion Quest, <a href=\"/x-factor-promised-vengeance/4000-65689/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-65689\">X-Factor #108</a> is an important read because it chronicles when Legion actually wakes from his coma. Then proceed to the Prelude before reading X-Factor #109. After that, there is a vignette in <a href=\"/x-men-birds-of-a-feather/4000-65740/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-65740\">X-Men #39</a> of Legion wandering the Israeli desert and receiving instructions from <a href=\"/destiny/4005-3557/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3557\">Destiny</a>. The story then picks up with the first numbered issue of Legion Quest in Uncanny X-Men #320.</p><p>An anomaly with this arc is that seven issues are included but only four are numbered as such. It's possible that this is because the events of the non-numbered issues happen concurrently. Or, that Marvel only numbered the X-Men titles for some reason.<br /><br /></p><h2>Related Issues</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/what-if-77-what-if-legion-had-killed-magneto/4000-41389/\">What If...? #77 - What if Legion Had Killed Magneto</a>?</li><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/what-if-x-men-age-of-apocalypse/4050-25127/\">What If?

The story follows Sir Nicholas Fury, the students from Carlos Javier's Select College for the Sons of Gentlefolk, Rojhaz the American Indian and others, as they attempt to decipher the riddle of strange and deadly weather patterns and foil the machinations of Count Otto Von Doom.</p><p>Eventually, the main characters discover that Earth-616 is coming apart in a para-temporal event caused by the untimely arrival of Steve Rogers, commonly known as Captain America, of Earth-460 having been sent more than 400 years back through time. They foil Von Doom's schemes and rescue the Four of the Fantastick, then head to America where they finally seal the rift by sending Captain America back through, and return Earth-616 to its proper timeline.</p><p>This reality has been named Earth-311.</p><h2>The characters</h2><p>The characters of Earth-311 are not alternate reality counterparts of Earth-616 characters, but analogues.</p><p>The following is a list of the characters, who they are on Earth-311, and who they are analogues of in Earth-616.</p><ul><li>Elizabeth I of England: Herself*</li><li>James I of England: Himself*</li><li><a href=\"/virginia-dare/4005-55179/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55179\">Virginia Dare</a>: No counterpart</li><li>Uatu, the Watcher: Himself*</li><li>Sir Nicholas Fury: Nick Fury*</li><li>Doctor Stephen Strange: Himself*</li><li>Peter Parquagh: Peter Parker (Spider-man)*</li><li>Matthew Murdoch: Matt Murdock (Daredevil)*</li><li>Clea Strange: Clea*</li><li>Rojhaz: Steve Rogers (Captian America)*</li><li>Carlos Javier: Charles Xavier*</li><li>The Four from the Fantastick: Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic), Sue Storm (Invisible Woman), John Storm (Human Torch), Ben Grimm (The Thing)*</li><li>Grand Inquisitor Enrique: Erik Magnus Lehnsherr (Magneto)*</li><li>David Banner: Bruce Banner (The Hulk)*</li><li>Count Otto von Doom: Victor Von Doom (Dr. Doom)*</li><li>Pestros: Pietro Django Maximoff (Quicksilver)*</li><li>Scotius Summerisle: Scott Summers (Cyclops)*</li><li>Robert Trefusis: Robert Drake (Iceman)*</li><li>John (Jean) Grey: Jean Grey*</li><li>Werner: Warren Worthington III (Angel)*</li><li>Master McCoy: Henry McCoy (Beast)*</li><li>Sister Wanda: Wanda Django Maximoff (Scarlet Witch)</li></ul><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/marvel-1602/4050-31889/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-31889\">Marvel 1602</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/100-marvel-1602-1-donde-las-cosas-comienzan-a-camb/4000-283223/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-283223\">100% Marvel. 1602 #1</a> (Spain)</li><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/100-marvel-1602-2-donde-se-pantea-una-traicion/4000-283224/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-283224\">100% Marvel. 1602 #2</a> (Spain)</li><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/coleccionable-marvel-heroes-42-marvel-1602/4000-612250/\">Coleccionable Marvel Héroes - Marvel 1602</a> (Spanish)</li></ul><p> </p>",

Hulk is infuriated when he discovers that Fury lied to him about the satellite which is actually one of <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">SHIELD</a>'s own. A message begins playing of the members of the <a href=\"/illuminati/4060-40421/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40421\">Illuminati</a> telling Hulk that he has been tricked, and is being exiled to an uninhabited far-off planet where he cannot hurt anyone and can finally live in peace. The ship was sucked into a portal and deposited Hulk on the violent planet <a href=\"/sakaar/4020-41069/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41069\">Sakaar</a>. Traveling through the wormhole has weakened Hulk, leaving his strength depleted and with the ability to sustain injury. Unable to resist Hulk is captured almost immediately upon arrival, and is forced to become a gladiator in the great arena for the viewing pleasure of the evil <a href=\"/red-king/4005-14846/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14846\">Red King</a> of Sakaar.</p><h3>Sakaarson</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6826558-hulk%20savage.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6826558\" data-ratio=\"1.5480769230769\" data-width=\"624\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 624px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6826558-hulk%20savage.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6826558\"><img alt=\"Hulk vs. Silver Savage\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6826558-hulk%20savage.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6826558-hulk%20savage.jpg 624w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6826558-hulk%20savage.jpg 620w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6826558-hulk%20savage.jpg 413w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 413px) 100vw, 413px\" data-width=\"413\"></a><figcaption>Hulk vs. Silver Savage</figcaption></figure><p>Hulk is forced to battle the <a href=\"/silver-surfer/4005-2502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\">Silver Surfer</a> (dubbed \"The Silver Savage\") in the gladiatorial arena. The Surfer had also been weakened when he was drawn through the wormhole that brought Hulk to Sakaar. Hulk recognized the Surfer, and rather than fight him for the Red King's amusement, Hulk smashed the control unit that kept the Surfer in check, allowing him to flee Sakaar and make his way to the events of the <a href=\"/annihilation/4045-41287/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-41287\">Annihilation</a>. As a gladiator in the arena, Hulk quickly makes an enemy of the Red King. After watching Hulk win several battles the Red King dons his battle suit to fight the Hulk. Not to be underestimated Hulk draws blood from the Red Kings face, an act which was until then unprecedented. As a means to save face the Red King makes a deal with Hulk, offering to allow the Hulk to go free as long as he is able to pass a certain number of trials. The motive for this apparent display of leniency is to make it appear so that Hulk has a fighting chance of his freedom, but to be able to kill him anyway. It is during these trials that Hulk would meet and forge a warbond with several allies on Sakaar: <a href=\"/korg/4005-43225/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43225\">Korg</a> the Kronan, <a href=\"/miek/4005-43226/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43226\">Miek</a> the insect, the <a href=\"/no-name/4005-43277/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43277\">No-name</a> Broodspawn, <a href=\"/hiroim/4005-43227/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43227\">Hiroim</a> the Shamed shadow priest, and <a href=\"/elloe/4005-43228/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43228\">Elloe</a>. These allies would become a force that could not be broken, no matter what trials the Red King threw their way. The more the Hulk was able to overcome, the more the people of Sakaar grew to support him. A growing number of the people of Sakaar also believed Hulk to be their fabled savior, the Sakaarson, after a plant was discovered to have sprung to life in the arena from where Hulk's blood touched the soil.</p><p>Hulk and his <a href=\"/warbound/4060-43240/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-43240\">Warbound</a> allies eventually escaped the Red King's control and made their way into the wilderness. Enraged, the Red King is growing more and more impatient with the Hulk and tries even harder to kill him, first sending his armies after him and then sending his personal bodyguard <a href=\"/caiera/4005-42037/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42037\">Caiera</a>, the shadowguard. Caiera, harboring an ancient power known only to her people as the Oldstrong had not found a match in pure power until meeting the Hulk. It was while Hulk battled Caiera that the Red King had finally had enough of the Hulk and sent in his most dangerous weapon: a plague of sentient spores known as the Spikes which consumed all living organisms, turning them into spikes too. The threat of the Spikes is too great for Caiera and Hulk to continue battling each other, for now they are in a race for their lives just to avoid the Spikes. Many of those around them are turned into spikes as well including Miek's queen, the last hope for their race.</p><p>Coming back to battle the Red King once final time, Hulk is able to release the spike leaders who revealed that they are captives of the Red King that crash landed on Sakaar a long time ago and do not mean to harm anyone. Now with an army supporting him, Hulk confronts the Red King who is desperate and sets off a charge that will destroy the planet from the inside. Jumping into the destruction of Sakaar, Hulk grabs the plates of the planet and pulls them back into place himself. As the planet's savior, Hulk slays the Red King. Now would be a time for rebuilding.</p><h3>King Hulk</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6826574-hulkster%20hero.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6826574\" data-ratio=\"0.92816091954023\" data-width=\"1044\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1044px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:92.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6826574-hulkster%20hero.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6826574\"><img alt=\"Hulk and the Warbound as heroes of the people\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6826574-hulkster%20hero.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6826574-hulkster%20hero.jpg 1044w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/6826574-hulkster%20hero.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6826574-hulkster%20hero.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hulk and the Warbound as heroes of the people\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6826574-hulkster%20hero.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6826574-hulkster%20hero.jpg 1044w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/6826574-hulkster%20hero.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6826574-hulkster%20hero.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hulk and the Warbound as heroes of the people</figcaption></figure><p>After the events of the final battle against the Red King, Hulk is looked to as the leader. All was not well at first. Hulk's allies against the Red King are now fighting with each other in an attempt to decide what to do with the Red King gone. Meeting in the arena once more former teammates prepare to battle each other until Hulk steps in and says that if they want to fight they can fight him. The Shadow Priests watch from a distance believing the Hulk to be no better than the Red King. Hulk forces the opposition to attack him, plunging their spears, arrows, and swords into his flesh. Hulk declared that they are all warbound with each other as they had teamed up against him, and need not fight each other. This proved once again that regardless of whether Hulk is the Sakaarson or not, Hulk is a natural leader for Sakaar.</p><p>Hulk allows the Spikes to feed off of him during the day so that no one else is harmed while they work on a way to send the spikes back into space where they belong. In love with Caiera, Hulk and Caiera become married and Caiera reveals to Hulk that she is pregnant with his child. Hulk returns the Spikes to space, and finally becomes more comfortable with his role as the new king of Sakaar. A new era of peace looms on the horizon for Sakaar as old relationships are rekindled, and as the Warbound now work together with the people of Sakaar to rebuild what the Red King had destroyed. It seems as if everything is all right. This is proof of the toughness of Hulk. Even launched into space on a desolate, angry planet, he managed to prosper.</p><p>Everything seemed almost too good to be true when the ship the Hulk was brought to Sakaar on began to emit warnings that its power systems were failing. Hulk was not able to send the ship into the atmosphere in time, and an explosion rocked the world destroying virtually all life (including Caiera) and setting the planet up for its demise once again. Hulk is found by the Warbound, some of the only survivors of the planet's destruction, and with them plots a course back to Earth to seek out the Illuminati to make them pay for destroying their paradise.

The film followed the plot of the original comic storyline fairly closely, but featured a few significant deviations from the plot, such as Beta Ray Bill being the controlled superhero the Hulk is forced to fight in the Red King's arena. The movie also featured a far more optimistic ending than the comic, with Caiera becoming the Hulk's bride, and the members of the Warbound being viewed as heroes by the people of Sakaar. The tragic twist ending of the comic never occurs, and thus the planet is not destroyed.</li></ul><h4>Live-Action</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5933949-9681131536-f6fd6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5933949\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5933949-9681131536-f6fd6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5933949\"><img alt=\"Hulk vs. Thor on Sakaar\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5933949-9681131536-f6fd6.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5933949-9681131536-f6fd6.jpg 1280w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/5933949-9681131536-f6fd6.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5933949-9681131536-f6fd6.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hulk vs. Thor on Sakaar\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5933949-9681131536-f6fd6.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5933949-9681131536-f6fd6.jpg 1280w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/5933949-9681131536-f6fd6.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5933949-9681131536-f6fd6.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hulk vs. Thor on Sakaar</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Certain plot elements of \"Planet Hulk\" were loosely adapted in the 2017 live-action film <a href=\"/thor-ragnarok/4025-2278/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-2278\"><em>Thor: Ragnarok</em></a>, part of the <a href=\"/marvel-cinematic-universe/4015-56089/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56089\">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>.

The heroes eventually escape from Sakaar, but not before helping Korg start a populist revolution against the Grandmaster's tyranny.</li></ul><h3>Video Games</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6826557-planet%20hulk%20mvc.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6826557\" data-ratio=\"1.1395939086294\" data-width=\"394\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 394px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:114.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6826557-planet%20hulk%20mvc.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6826557\"><img alt=\"Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px\" data-width=\"561\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6826557-planet%20hulk%20mvc.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6826557-planet%20hulk%20mvc.jpg 394w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6826557-planet%20hulk%20mvc.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6826557-planet%20hulk%20mvc.jpg 394w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px\" data-width=\"561\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Marvel Animation released a free online flash game called <em>Planet Hulk: Gladiators</em> to promote the animated movie.</li><li>The Hulk's time on Sakaar is referenced in <em>Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2</em>.</li><li>When facing the Hulk in <em>Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3</em>, Doctor Strange references his part in launching the Hulk into space.

Realizing they were on Earth, a world known to have countless superhumans, the escaped prisoners begin preparations for a hasty escape off-world.</p><p>The dimwitted Drax opposes his fellow escapees, but is murdered when Paibok assumes the form of Thanos (whom Drax was created to destroy), taking Drax off-guard just long enough to kill him. <a href=\"/cammi/4005-41747/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41747\">Cammi</a>, a local girl bargains with Paibok and somehow claims ownership of Drax’s body. She is rather surprised however when the body returns to life transformed. Drax had lost much of his power, but he has regained his intellect and received all the instincts and senses of a true warrior.</p><p>In short order, Drax kills Lunatik and one of the Blood Brothers before Paibok fearing for his own safety summons his former captors to take him back into custody. Paibok, Drax, and Cammi are all escorted off-planet aboard the prison ship Dredge 02.</p><h2>Annihilation</h2><p>Events of the Annihilation are chronicled in terms of the Annihilation Day.</p><p><b>A.D. -7</b></p><p><a href=\"/crunch-cascade/4020-57682/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57682\">The Crunch</a> lying at the center of the universe is the region in which all space expands from. The energies released by the Crunch have been used as a prison for countless millennia to contain criminals and unwanted entities from around the universe. This prison was called the <a href=\"/the-kyln/4020-56324/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56324\">Kyln</a>.</p><p><a href=\"/thanos/4005-7607/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\">Thanos</a> of Titan recently visited Kyln, he claimed the chaos mite <a href=\"/skreet/4005-42605/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42605\">Skreet</a> as a pet and the seeming first herald of <a href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\">Galactus</a>, the <a href=\"/fallen-one/4005-40877/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40877\">Fallen One</a> as his own herald. <a href=\"/death/4005-12620/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12620\">Death</a> (in the form of a young girl) appears to Thanos and tells him something wonderful will soon emerge from the Crunch.</p><p><b>Annihilation Day</b></p><p>An exceedingly large armada of starships manned by insectoid creatures emerges from the Crunch and lays waste to the Kyln. This large armada, dubbed the Annihilation Wave, follows one simple command: Extinguish life wherever they find it. Their lord, <a href=\"/annihilus/4005-10964/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10964\">Annihilus</a> has declared war upon our universe as it is always expanding while his <a href=\"/the-negative-zone/4020-40699/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40699\">Negative Zone</a> is always contracted, which Annihilus sees as an invasion of his territory by our universe.</p><p><b>Annihilation Day 7</b></p><p>On <a href=\"/xandar/4020-56106/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56106\">Xandar</a>, the Nova Corps convenes to prepare to confront the <a href=\"/annihilation-wave/4060-55905/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55905\">Annihilation Wave</a>, as they do the Wave attacks, a brief, but fierce battle Xandar is destroyed and all the Nova Corps are dead except one. <a href=\"/nova/4005-2105/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2105\">Nova</a>, the Nova of Earth. Drax and Cammi, who arrived on Xandar the same day are able to escape death with the help of Drax’s finely tuned instincts. As Richard surveys the destruction Xandar he falls to his knees, defeated.</p><p><b>A.D. 11</b></p><p>Apparently having fallen into a coma, Nova recovers to the Xandarian Worldmind attempting to contact him. It is in danger of going offline. If the Worldmind be goes offline, the <a href=\"/nova-force/4015-56037/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56037\">Nova Force</a> itself and all that remains of Xandar’s knowledge and culture would also be lost forever. In order to maintain the Worldmind, Nova allows the Worldmind and all the power of the Nova Force to be downloaded into him.</p><p>Drunk on his newfound power, Nova sets out to destroy the Annihilation Wave, in the ensuing battle, he loses control of the power and nearly kills himself. Recovering in the crater he created when he crash-landed, he encounters the only other known survivors of the destruction of Xandar, Drax and Cammi.</p><p>The trio set out to find salvageable transport off Xandar. After some resistance from the Annihilation Wave’s carrion feeders, they are able to find a Nova Corps transport, which Nova interfaces with to order to open a stargate to escape the Annihilation Wave.</p><p>The ship arrives in orbit of Nycos Aristedes, a planet 7.8 light-years from Xandar and quickly loses power. As the ship begins to fall out of orbit they are saved by <a href=\"/quasar/4005-3319/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3319\">Quasar</a>, the Protector of the Universe, who is an old friend of Nova’s.</p><p>They quickly find that Quasar is overseeing a mass-evacuation before the Wave can reach the planet. Quasar manages to talk Nova into assisting despite the objections of the Worldmind and Drax. Nova attempts to open another stargate for the colonists to escape though, but Annihilus sensing the power of the stargate attacks. Nova and Quasar defend the colonists and take the fight to the capital ships of the Annihilation Wave itself. Seeking to stop Annihilus before this invasion gets any worse they attempt to kill Annihilus, but he is ready for them.</p><p>During the brief struggle Quasar is slain and his <a href=\"/quantum-bands/4055-42361/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-42361\">Quantum Bands</a> are claimed by Annihilus, making him even more powerful. In a desperate gambit, as Annihilus attempts to drain the Nova Force as he had Quasar’s Quantum-power, the Worldmind interfaces with the Wave’s hive-mind, causing the fleet to attack itself. Nova barely escapes with his life and is retrieved by Drax and Cammi and is quickly treated for his wounds. Annihilus tasting defeat for the first time orders a retreat.</p><p><b>A.D. 12</b></p><p><a href=\"/ronan/4005-4818/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4818\">Ronan</a> the Accuser of the <a href=\"/kree/4060-7588/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-7588\">Kree</a> is taken into military custody to face court martial for crimes against the Empire.</p><p><b>A.D. 15</b></p><p>While performing espionage against the Kree, the <a href=\"/super-skrull/4005-21332/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21332\">Super-Skrull</a> learns of the Annihilation Wave’s destruction of several <a href=\"/skrull/4005-13341/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13341\">Skrull</a> worlds and its weapon, the Harvester of Sorrows.</p><p><b>A.D. 17</b></p><p>Annihilus orders his forces to bring him the heralds of Galactus alive in the hopes of analyzing and mastering the <a href=\"/power-cosmic/4015-41039/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-41039\">Power Cosmic</a>. To that end, <a href=\"/ravenous/4005-41748/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41748\">Ravenous</a>, Annihilus’ chief lieutenant assaults the android re-creation of Gabriel <a href=\"/air-walker/4005-7126/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7126\">Air-Walker</a> a former herald, who had been drawn to the destruction of Xandar, his former homeworld. The <a href=\"/silver-surfer/4005-2502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\">Silver Surfer</a> arrives and manages to drive off Ravenous and his <a href=\"/seekers/4060-58789/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58789\">Seekers</a>, but not before Air Walker is far too badly damaged to sustain himself. Surfer marks his friend’s passing by creating a black hole where Gabriel fell.</p><p><b>A.D. 19</b></p><p><a href=\"/terrax/4005-2106/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2106\">Terrax</a> the Tamer confronts the Seekers, but is captured. Silver Surfer enters Skrull space and surveys the destruction wrought by the Annihilation Wave and vows to stop Annihilus. Amongst the wreckage Surfer finds a former indentured slave of the Skrulls named Tarq Maru who the Surfers bring to safety rather than leaving him to die. During this time Surfer is attacked by more Seekers but despite having them outmatched watches as they are cut down by his fellow former heralds <a href=\"/firelord/4005-7108/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7108\">Firelord</a> and <a href=\"/red-shift/4005-40878/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40878\">Red Shift</a>. Meanwhile, Thanos meets with Annihilus to form an alliance.</p><p><b>A.D. 20</b></p><p>Two ancient entities freed by the decimation of the Kyln prison slowly come to grips with how much the universe has grown and changed since their imprisonment and vow revenge upon their captor, Galactus. As these beings, <a href=\"/tenebrous/4005-42608/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42608\">Tenebrous</a> and <a href=\"/aegis/4005-42607/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42607\">Aegis</a> discover the Fallen One amongst the ruins, sensing Galactus’ power coursing through his body they capture and question him.</p><p>Silver Surfer, Firelord, and Red Shift deposit Tarq Maru with a refugee fleet departing Skrull space, they are quickly joined by <a href=\"/stardust/4005-7491/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7491\">Stardust</a>, Galactus’ current herald, who directs the Surfer to an audience with his former master.</p><p>Annihilus reveals his quest to gain the <a href=\"/power-cosmic/4015-41039/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-41039\">Power Cosmic</a> to Thanos despite the former’s failure to capture it from the dying body of another former herald, <a href=\"/morg/4005-7122/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7122\">Morg</a>.</p><p><b>A.D. 21</b></p><p>When the Silver Surfer arrives to meet with Galactus, his former master reveals the threat of Aegis and Tenebrous and requests that the Surfer rejoin him as his herald. Surfer agrees and Galactus readies the Surfer for the coming conflict with more power just as Ravenous and the Seekers arrive with the advanced scouts of the Annihilation Wave, having tracked the Surfer there, and demands that Galactus surrender to them. Galactus simply unleashes the Silver Surfer upon them and watches with mute interest as he devastates the fleet and elegantly defeats Ravenous, asking that they retreat back to the Negative Zone. Ravenous declines and is nearly killed.</p><p><b>A.D. 29</b></p><p>Ronan’s court martial is held, during which the Rigellian <a href=\"/tana-nile/4005-6142/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6142\">Tana Nile</a> gives false testimony of Ronan’s treason and he is summarily stripped of his title of Accuser.</p><p><b>A.D. 40</b></p><p>Thanos, drawn by the Fallen One’s summons, meets with Aegis and Tenebrous where he learns of their similar goals, so they strike a deal: If Tenebrous and Aegis defeat Galactus, Thanos will see him imprisoned.</p><p><b>A.D. 41</b></p><p>In a pitched battle, the Skrull world of Aks’lo is destroyed by the <a href=\"/harvester-of-sorrow/4055-57056/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57056\">Harvester of Sorrows</a>, Super-Skrull narrowly escapes death.</p><p><b>A.D. 46</b></p><p>Super Skrull asks Baroness S’Bak if he may lead a force against the Harvester itself to destroy it before it reaches Zaragz’na, a former Skrull homeworld. This world also is where Super Skrull’s son lives. S’Bak denies permission. Super-Skrull goes rogue and decides to destroy the Harvester with or without the help of the Skrull Empire. He is joined in this suicidal venture by a young Skrull engineer named <a href=\"/rkin/4005-42609/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42609\">R'Kin</a>.</p><p><b>A.D. 47</b></p><p>R’Kin and Super-Skrull travel to Earth to meet with the one man in the entire universe who has access to the Negative Zone, Reed Richards, who agrees to give them access to his portal.</p><p><b>A.D. 48</b></p><p>Super-Skrull and R’Kin gain access to a Negative Zone vessel at the expense of it crew, who are spaced.</p><p><b>A.D. 52</b></p><p>Super-Skrull interrogates a member of the Annihilation Wave and learns that the Harvester of Sorrows was created by Hawal.</p><p><b>A.D. 55</b></p><p>They find Hawal on UX-73, a penal colony. Super-Skrull defeats the security forces and then recruits the inmates against Hawal, who had committed many experiments against them against their will.

They are captured and brought onboard the Harvester and they are forced to watch as Zaragz’na is destroyed. Desperate for escape and revenge, Super-Skrull hypnotizes R’Kin into freeing them. R’Kin flees as Super Skrull kills Admiral Salo and prepares to destroy the Harvester with the help of <a href=\"/preak/4005-42333/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42333\">Preak</a> and Praxagora. Super-Skrull exacts his revenge upon R’Kin by tearing off his limbs and cauterizing the stumps, then leaving him barely alive tied to a bulkhead within a shuttle. Preak is killed attempting to overload the Harvester’s core. Super Skrull refuses to allow Praxagora to sacrifice herself for his cause, he absorbs the energy he needs from her and kisses her farewell. He destroys the Harvester of Sorrow. Praxagora later recovers his body.</p><p><b>A.D. 79</b></p><p>By now most Skrull worlds are either subjugated or destroyed.</p><p><b>A.D. 88</b></p><p>A still deposed Ronan exacts Kree justice on the world of Bwokk and then continues his tracking of Tana Nile to the insignificant world of Godthab Omega.</p><p><b>A.D. 95</b></p><p>Once at Godthab Omega, Ronan reunites with his longtime friend <a href=\"/korath-the-pursuer/4005-42604/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42604\">Korath the Pursuer</a> and former teammate from the Kree Starforce. Korath disregards the ruling against Ronan, knowing his friend to be innocent. Ronan enlists Korath in his search for Tana Nile, but before they can begin they are attacked by two women, <a href=\"/stellaris/4005-25714/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25714\">Stellaris</a> and <a href=\"/nebula/4005-14558/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14558\">Nebula</a>.

Sadly, this not to be as the Annihilation Wave is on its way. Annihilus sensing Glorian in the act of creation directs one of his mates, Eradica, to take a contingent of ships to destroy all life on that world.</p><p><b>A.D. 99</b></p><p>Ronan and Gamora are in the midst of trying to kill each other when Korath informs them of the Annihilation Wave’s immanent arrival. They join forces to combat the Wave, but Glorian’s power ultimately defeats the Wave, though the effort leaves him a mental vegetable.</p><p>Tana Nile is fatally wounded in the battle, but she admits to Ronan just before she dies that the Kree ruling House Fiyero instructed her to frame him. Ronan and Gamora prepare the survivors for transport to Kree space to warn the empire about the Annihilation Wave.</p><p>At some point between day 100 and 200 since the Annihilation Wave breached the Crunch, several things happen in which we don’t have an exact date.</p><p>Nova and Drax form the United Front to oppose the Annihilation Wave. The Battle of Tartus Minor during which the United Front is defeated. Peter “Starlord” Quill, Firelord, Stardust, Red Shift, Ronan, Gamora, and, presumably, their followers join the United Front.</p><p><b>A.D. 183</b></p><p>While visiting the final resting place of <a href=\"/captain-marvel/4005-1472/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1472\">Captain Marvel</a> and his son, <a href=\"/genis-vell/4005-4813/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4813\">Genis-Vell</a>, <a href=\"/phyla/4005-40922/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40922\">Phyla</a> and her lover <a href=\"/moondragon/4005-7214/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7214\">Moondragon</a> are assaulted by Thanos. He takes Moondragon captive leaving her torn ear with Phyla to give to Moondragon’s father, Drax as a message.</p><p><b>A.D. 204</b></p><p>The United Front barely holds out against the Annihilation Wave on the Kree world of Daedalus 5, taking Extirpa (another of Annihilus’ mates) prisoner in the process thanks to Firelord.</p><p><b>A.D. 206</b></p><p>Extirpa shows to the commanders of the United Front imagery (via the Annihilation Wave’s hive-mind) of Galactus’ and Silver Surfer’s defeat at the hands of Tenebrous and Aegis, declaring the war is already lost to the United Front.</p><p><b>A.D. 212</b></p><p>Phyla arrives at Daedalus 5 and tells Drax of Moondragon’s fate. He seems determined to fulfill his purpose. To destroy Thanos even if it means the death of his daughter. When members of House Fiyero attempt to arrest Ronan he kills them. Praxagora arrives with Super-Skrull’s body and tells of his honorable death. Without warning Ravenous invades with Terrax, one of the Mad Thinker’s androids, Paibok, and the <a href=\"/infant-terrible/4005-20026/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20026\">Infant Terrible</a>, all controlled by parasites.</p><p>The battle is evenly matched until Ravenous is joined by the Centurions one hundred warriors from many of the worlds conquered by the Annihilation Wave. The United Front’s defeat is quickly turned into a rout when Red Shift and Stardust become aware that Galactus is in the vicinity, the world is lost. In the chaos that follows Super-Skrull is miraculously resurrected by a fallen Firelord. Drax stays behind to get a shot at Thanos, leaving Cammi with the evacuees. Red Shift and Stardust sacrifice their lives to hold off Galactus’ power from destroying the planet long enough for everyone to escape Daedalus 5.</p><p>In the aftermath the United Front disbands in the face of this terrible defeat. Ronan, Super-Skrull, and Praxagora all set out for Hala to overthrow House Fiyero, while Nova plots to kill Annihilus.</p><p><b>A.D. 220</b></p><p>Drax manages to get off-world before it is consumed by Galactus’ power (controlled by Thanos), he reaches Eradica and kills her, using the vessel to get closer to Thanos’ ship. Meanwhile, Nova warns Earth of the Annihilation Wave, but intercepts transmissions about how the Superhuman Registration Act has fractured the heroes into a <a href=\"/civil-war/4045-40615/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40615\">Civil War</a>.</p><p>On Hala, Ronan, Super Skrull and Praxagora discover that House Fiyero has brokered a treaty with the Annihilation Wave, which would shelter Ravenous and the Centurions on Hala. A furious Ronan delivers a crushing blow to Ravenous. Discovering the <a href=\"/supreme-intelligence/4005-6096/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6096\">Supreme Intelligence</a> lobotomized, a merciful Ronan ends its existence. He is quickly declared emperor by the Kree people.</p><p>Moondragon reveals through her scans that Annihilus’ ultimate goal is to end all life in not only our universe but the Negative Zone as well, so that he can rule over the void that remains. No longer interested in helping Annihilus, Thanos releases Moondragon from the parasites, and is about to release Galactus when Drax bursts in and tears Thanos’ heart from his chest as Moondragon helplessly looks on.</p><p>Moondragon explains the circumstances to her father and he attempts to make it right by freeing the Silver Surfer who in turn frees Galactus, who in his rage decimates the Annihilation Wave.</p><p>As the Annihilation Wave finds itself quickly becoming annihilated by an angry Galactus, Nova, Phyla, and Quill confront Annihilus. At first Annihilus brutally overpowers Nova, but the Quantum bands choose Phyla to be their new bearer, turning the tide. Annihilus is weakened enough for Nova to tear his insides out, killing him.</p><p>With the Annihilation Wave destroyed by Galactus and Annihilus dead, the threat is over for the time being.</p><h2>Aftermath</h2><p><b>A.D. 222</b></p><p>With Annihilus dead, the parasites controlling Terrax, Paibok, and Delinquent are deactivated. The trio escape to New Xeron, a world ruled by the Space Parasite, whom Terrax kills and then he destroys the planet, reminding the universe that he is a man to be feared.</p><p><b>A.D. 227</b></p><p>Stardust reforms after its destruction and returns to Galactus and finds that his former master requires more sustenance to survive. Stardust gives Galactus the energy of the last survivors of its race as a demonstration of its loyalty to Galactus.</p><p><b>A.D. 268: Armistice Day</b></p><p>Hostilities are brought to an official end and a treaty is signed. All of Skrull space and large portions of Kree space (including the one time capitol of Kree-Lar) are ceded to Ravenous and the surviving forces of the Annihilation Wave.</p><p>Phyla and Moondragon are reunited. Phyla still bears the Quantum bands and considered following in Quasar’s footsteps and her father, Mar-Vell as Protector of the Universe.</p><p>Cammi seems to have found a new ally in Skreet.</p><p><b>A.D. 274</b></p><p>Firelord refuses to accept the terms of surrender and seeks revenge upon the former forces of the Annihilation Wave, though he learns that there are some Centurions who believe that Annihilus had corrupted their purpose. He briefly aids some Centurions on Omina Prime.</p><p><b>A.D. 277</b></p><p>On Kree-Lar, Annihilus’ queen dies giving birth to Annihilus’ scion, Annihilus himself is reborn.</p><p><b>A.D. 281</b></p><p>The Silver Surfer confronts Aegis and Tenebrous on behalf of his master. Destroying them within the Crunch, nearly dying himself in the process. He is healed by a very impressed Galactus.</p><p>Once healed from his wounds sustained during his battle with Annihilus, Nova continues to act as the sole member of the Nova Corps, putting out brush fires still remaining from the war. Despite the Worldmind’s wishes he has yet to begin to rebuild the Corps.</p><h2>Issue Checklist</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/drax-the-destroyer/4050-18291/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18291\">Drax the Destroyer</a></li><li><a href=\"/drax-the-destroyer/4050-18291/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18291\">Annihilation: Prologue</a></li><li><a href=\"/annihilation-the-nova-corps-files/4050-18159/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18159\">Annihilation: Nova Corps Files</a></li><li><a href=\"/annihilation-nova/4050-18017/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18017\">Annihilation: Nova</a></li><li><a href=\"/annihilation-silver-surfer/4050-20185/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-20185\">Annihilation: Silver Surfer</a></li><li><a href=\"/annihilation-super-skrull/4050-18018/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18018\">Annihilation: Super-Skrull</a></li><li><a href=\"/annihilation-ronan/4050-20186/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-20186\">Annihilation: Ronan</a></li><li><a href=\"/annihilation/4050-18137/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18137\">Annihilation</a></li><li><a href=\"/annihilation-heralds-of-galactus/4050-18215/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18215\">Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus</a></li></ul><h2>Related Story-Arcs</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/annihilation-conquest/4045-44982/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-44982\">Annihilation Conquest</a> - Starting in June 2007, Annihilation: Conquest is the sequel to the Annihilation story-arc.</li></ul><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/annihilation-book-one/4050-28880/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-28880\">Annihilation, Book One</a></li><li><a href=\"/annihilation-book-two/4050-28886/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-28886\">Annihilation, Book Two</a></li><li><a href=\"/annihilation-book-three/4050-28935/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-28935\">Annihilation, Book Three</a></li><li><a href=\"../../marvel-your-universe-volume-2/37-201642/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marvel: Your Universe Vol. 2</a></li><li><a href=\"../../secret-invasion-chronicles-book-four/37-200647/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Secret Invasion Chronicles #4</a></li></ul><h2>Related Issues</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/annihilation-saga-annihilation-saga/4000-152203/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-152203\">Annihilation Saga #1 - Annihilation Saga</a></li><li><a href=\"/what-if-annihilation-what-if-annihilation-reached-earth/4000-120235/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-120235\">What If?

N'astirh orchestrated a kidnapping of 13 babies of Earth in hopes to sacrifice them in a ritual known as Inferno, which would have given him control over both dimensions. Previously, N'astirh had also contacted the woman known as <a href=\"/madelyne-pryor/4005-10981/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10981\">Madelyne Pryor</a>, sensing her power as a clone of Phoenix (<a href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\">Jean Grey</a>) and helped her release her power in what would eventually make her the Goblin Queen.</p><p>First, N’astirh opened a gateway between Earth and Limbo through which his demon horde could travel, using the 13 children's souls as energy for the pentagram-shaped nexus. Inferno had begun, and New York began to feel its effects. The weather turned hot, unearthly hot, and people began to succumb to their more evil desires. Even inanimate objects began to be effected, coming to life and acting in malicious, evil ways.</p><p>N’astirh was ultimately defeated by the <a href=\"/new-mutants/4060-15971/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15971\">New Mutants</a> and Magik, who rejected her dark heritage and reverted to her innocent six-year old self.

He turned to the mutant-enhancing drug <a href=\"/kick/4015-42307/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-42307\"> Kick</a> before it was known that Kick was actually the aerosol form of the <a href=\"/sublime/4005-11330/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11330\"> Sublime</a> bacteria. Sublime took over Beast's body, and used it to continue his quest for mutant extermination. The Sublime Beast would experiment on himself, turning white and slowing down the aging process. With access to genetic samples of all the X-Men he created a hybrid race from mutant DNA that were called the crawlers. The crawlers were based on <a href=\"/nightcrawler/4005-1461/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1461\"> Nightcrawler</a>'s DNA, giving them a similar appearance and his power of teleportation. He continued to develop them, adding in the genetic traits of other mutants and giving the ability to duplicate themselves (from the <a href=\"/madrox/4005-7910/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7910\"> Madrox</a>), eye-beams (presumably from Cyclops's power), wings, and more. He developed a laboratory that worked as a factory for generating crawlers, and doing other experiments. At some point he gained control of <a href=\"/fantomex/4005-4281/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4281\"> Fantomex</a>, grafting new parts onto him and turning him into the last of his <a href=\"/u-men/4060-47994/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47994\"> U-Men</a>. Now called Apollyon the Destroyer, Fantomex became the Beast's herald, carrying out his bidding.</p><p>Around 150 years from Jean's death a <a href=\"/phoenix-force/4005-2164/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2164\"> Phoenix Force</a> egg was found dormant on the moon. This was brought to the Earth. The mutants that discovered the Egg did not have it for long as Apollyon was sent to retrieve it for his master. If Beast were to gain control of the egg he would have control over the Phoenix would be virtually unstoppable. The egg was entrusted into the care of <a href=\"/tom-skylark/4005-41731/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41731\"> Tom Skylark</a>. Tom's longtime companion <a href=\"/rover/4005-41732/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41732\"> Rover</a>, one of the last of the original Sentinels, was used to transport the egg. Tom and Rover escaped with the egg as his teammates were being slain by Apollyon and the crawlers. Tom sought out the X-Men to help protect the egg. After he had Rover destroy a pack of crawlers that were following them Tom located <a href=\"/eva/4005-45709/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45709\"> E.V.A</a>. E.V.A. was Apollyon's sentinel external nervous system when he was still Fantomex. She took them back to the X-Men's base not knowing that one of the crawlers had hitched a ride inside of Rover.</p><p>Back at the X-Men's base the crawler teleported out and began to duplicate himself. E.V.A. called upon the X-Men to help protect the egg. <a href=\"/tito/4005-41733/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41733\"> Tito</a> arrived to help beat off the intruders, but several swarmed over Rover and were able to teleport the egg back to the Beast's lair. The surviving three <a href=\"/stepford-cuckoos/4060-4443/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-4443\"> Stepford Cuckoos</a>, now simply going by the three-in-one told <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\"> Wolverine</a> and <a href=\"/cassandra-nova/4005-11317/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11317\"> Cassandra Nova</a> (now going by Cassandra Nova Xavier) about their dreams of the start of a new dark age. Now possessing the Phoenix egg the Beast would try to live out his dreams of stopping evolution. He could potentially encode the traits of the Phoenix into his armies or even in himself. Tom got Rover back, disinfected and safe. Rover looked even more torn up than before.</p><p>Back at the Beast's layer Apollyon begged him for grafts from the phoenix. Beast called upon his crawlers to use their power to incubate the phoenix egg, causing it to hatch prematurely. Jean Grey came out of the egg, drawn back from the <a href=\"/white-hot-room/4020-50483/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-50483\"> White Hot Room</a> early and because of this was confused. Beast greeted her, unknowing that her old friend was now taken over by the Sublime entity. Beast sent her out to kill the Termids, a race of insects, where she found Bumbleboy the X-Men's ambassador to the Termid multitude. She killed him but before sending his consciousness to the White Hot Room she kept his essence in his skull to learn about the X-Men.</p><p>Meanwhile Beast had grafted the traits of a mind parasite onto one of his crawlers and sent it to destroy the X-Men. The crawler burst both of its lungs to teleport into the school through the X-Men's shields. The X-Men fought it, not realizing that the mind-parisite was taking hold of them. The out of control X-Men came after the Stepford Cukoos who were held up with Cerebra. Not wishing to be eaten by the Mind Parasite that had taken hold of the others, the Cuckoos turned on an auto-destruct sequence for their consciousness, and slapped each other a high-five as the former X-Men broke into the building.</p><p>Deep in the ocean <a href=\"/mer-max/4005-50510/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50510\"> Mer-Max</a> was being attacked by a ship full of Crawlers. <a href=\"/cassandra-nova/4005-11317/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11317\"> Cassandra Nova</a> and <a href=\"/martha-johansson/4005-41121/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41121\"> Martha Johansson</a> arrived in their jet just in time, sending the Crawlers into fits of pain with intense telepathic noise. <a href=\"/rover/4005-41732/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41732\"> Rover</a>, <a href=\"/tom-skylark/4005-41731/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41731\"> Tom Skylark</a>, <a href=\"/tito-bohusk-jr/4005-41733/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41733\"> Beak</a>, and <a href=\"/eva/4005-45709/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45709\"> E.V.A</a> followed right behind. Tom was about to tell E.V.A. something in case they didn't make it, but before he got the chance the Crawlers began to teleport around Rover, and attacked him until he plunged into the ocean depths. Tom cried out for his partner to no avail, and the ocean liner they were on was now sinking.</p><p>When Phoenix arrived back she asked Submlime about the X-Men. He told her that they were enemies that needed to be destroyed. He explained to her that they just continue to become more powerful, resisting his influence and dominating the planet. He wishes to finally exterminate them. Sublime sent Phoenix after the remaining X-Men, and he remained at his hide-out. Sublime told the agonized Apollyon about his life which began eons ago. He described how as a bacterial life form he arose from the Earth to become the dominant life-form. Even the rise of humanity could not sway him, and he continued to infect and spread as he pleased. The rise of mutants created generations of homo-superior that were growing more and more immune, some capable of power on a cosmic scale. These mutants challanged his position as the dominant life form on Earth, and for the first time he felt the fear of extinction. In almost unbearable anguish Apollyon demanded Sublime give him the power of the Phoenix, grafts that would finally make him feel whole. As Sublime finished his story he climbed into a chamber which would give him a portion of the Phoenix power, not Apollyon.</p><p>Back in the ocean Phoenix had found Wolverine. Phoenix told him how the mutants time was over and that she would be their destroyer. Wolverine tried to talk Jean out of it, trying to force her to remember her life before. Cassandra and Martha flew in. Cassandra had read the <a href=\"/shiar/4015-43138/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-43138\"> Shi'ar</a> files on the Phoenix, and discovered how to telepathically unplug that power from its host. Wolverine caught Jean and she seemed to be remembering her old life. Wolverine described how after her death Cyclops simply gave up, and that Beast eventually became infected by Sublime due to the pressures of trying to run the school. Sublime arrived with his new power and blew up Cassandra and Martha's ship. Beak was the first to attack and was fried by Sublime. Tom summoned what he could of his power to call Rover back to help. Sublime fought off both Rover and E.V.A., causing E.V.A.'s software to go haywire. After watching Beak die Wolverine lunged at Sublime, but it was no use. Sublime turned off Wolverine's healing factor and cast him aside. As he fell Martha assured him that they were all going to the <a href=\"/white-hot-room/4020-50483/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-50483\"> White Hot Room</a>.</p><p>As Sublime believed his victory was guaranteed Phoenix informed him that he had lost. She extracted the Sublime bacteria from Beast's body. Beast was back, but not for long. Appolyon had arrived and removed Beast's head. Wolverine was finally at peace and Tom rushed to aid the dying E.V.A.</p><p>Phoenix went back to the White Hot Room where she sanitizes that timeline by cutting it off where it went bad. Hundreds of other Phoenix hosts were there with her and helped her including <a href=\"/kid-omega/4005-40583/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40583\"> Kid Omega</a>, the Green Phoenix. Here Jean was dressed in a white and gold Phoenix outfit as the White Phoenix of the Crown. She healed the broken time-line, urging Cyclops to live. Back in the present, when Scott had made the decision to abandon the X-Men (thereby causing this timeline to occur) Scott was again presented with the decision to leave or stay by Emma Frost. Standing over Jean's grave Scott decided this time that he wanted to go on, fixing the time-line permanently.</p><p> </p><h2>Related Story-Arcs</h2><p><a href=\"/planet-x/4045-50498/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-50498\"> Planet X</a> - Jean's death at the hands of <a href=\"/xorn/4005-3183/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3183\"> Xorn</a> created the alternate time-line where Here Comes Tomorrow takes place.</p><p> </p><h2>Additional Information</h2><p>This reality is designated Earth-15104. </p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/new-x-men-here-comes-tomorrow/4050-30258/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-30258\">New X-Men: Here Comes Tomorrow</a></li><li><a href=\"/new-x-men-ultimate-collection-book-3/4000-186307/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-186307\">New X-Men Ultimate Collection Vol. 3</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/new-x-men-109/4000-292442/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-292442\">New X-Men #109</a> (Spain)</li><li><a href=\"/new-x-men-110/4000-292443/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-292443\">New X-Men #110</a> (Spain)</li><li><a href=\"/new-x-men-111/4000-292444/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-292444\">New X-Men #111</a> (Spain)</li></ul>",

As part of his plan, Loki engineers a prison break at <a href=\"/the-vault/4020-43582/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-43582\">the Vault</a>. The main thrust of the issues involved in this line-wide event is that heroes face off against unfamiliar enemies, for example, Mandarin appears in the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a> issues, and <a href=\"/rusty/4005-46343/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46343\">Rusty</a> and <a href=\"/skids/4005-3194/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3194\">Skids</a> of the <a href=\"/new-mutants/4060-15971/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15971\">New Mutants</a> battle the <a href=\"/vulture/4005-4459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4459\">Vulture</a>.</p><p>The assembled villains fail to operate in a cohesive way, thwarting their plans to kill their enemies. Loki ends up imprisoning the Kingpin, Mandarin and Wizard in frustration, when the Wizard accidentally reveals the location of their secret meeting place on the <a href=\"/isle-of-silence/4020-56135/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56135\">Isle of Silence</a>. The Avengers track Loki down and Thor banishes him back to Asgard. Doctor Doom backs out of the arrangement and pursues his own scheme to defeat the Fantastic Four, as his own self-importance means he can't allow anyone else to defeat them. While the Fantastic Four are called to Congress to testify on the proposed Superhuman Registration Act, he sends a random assortment of villains to attack them.</p><p>Although this event was huge in its scope, covering almost every title in Marvel's line-up at the time, it had few lasting consequences. The most significant outcomes perhaps were the transformation of <a href=\"/psylocke/4005-3176/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3176\">Psylocke</a> into an Asian ninja assassin, and the first appearance of the <a href=\"/new-warriors/4060-11896/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-11896\">New Warriors</a> team in comics (in the pages of <a href=\"/thor/4050-2294/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2294\">Thor</a>).

    "description": "<p>The three chapters are to be taken as happening concurrently.</p><h3>Generation Next (Chapter One)</h3><p>To some humans, mutants are simply a scary step on the evolutionary ladder. Humans are unable to top this next phase naturally. Not content with this state of affairs, both <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14861\" href=\"/steven-lang/4005-14861/\" slug=\"steven-lang\">Stephen Lang</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13379\" href=\"/cameron-hodge/4005-13379/\" slug=\"cameron-hodge\">Cameron Hodge</a> allow themselves to be assimilated into the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9651\" href=\"/phalanx/4005-9651/\" slug=\"phalanx\">Phalanx</a>. This act, they hope, will ensure that humans have a leg-up on the evolutionary ladder. One problem stands in the way of mutant domination: mutants cannot be assimilated into the Phalanx. For this reason, the Phalanx goes after the next generation of mutants, so as to find some way to cure the mutant immunity.</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-9708\" href=\"/banshee/4005-9708/\" slug=\"banshee\">Banshee</a> visits the X-Mansion and notices that the X-Men are acting odd. Running a computer scan, he learns that the only mutants in the mansion are himself, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1457\" href=\"/emma-frost/4005-1457/\" slug=\"emma-frost\">Emma Frost</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4562\" href=\"/jubilee/4005-4562/\" slug=\"jubilee\">Jubilee</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4563\" href=\"/sabretooth/4005-4563/\" slug=\"sabretooth\">Sabretooth</a>. The four manage to get free and learn of the Phalanx objective of finding the newer mutants. They are able to save one, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10576\" href=\"/synch/4005-10576/\" slug=\"synch\">Synch</a>, before heading to California (a lead they got from following <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3426\" href=\"/husk/4005-3426/\" slug=\"husk\">Husk</a>'s psy-trail from when she got captured). There, Emma and Banshee break into a <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\" href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" slug=\"shield\">SHIELD</a> base and trace the Phalanx signature to a boat in San Diego.</p><p>The Phalanx is successful in capturing Husk, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40460\" href=\"/m/4005-40460/\" slug=\"m\">Monet</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12548\" href=\"/blink/4005-12548/\" slug=\"blink\">Blink</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10566\" href=\"/skin/4005-10566/\" slug=\"skin\">Skin</a>. In their cell, they band together and find a way out of their cell, only to come face-to-face with the Phalanx. Fortunately, Banshee and company arrive to save the younger mutants, but it is only Blink who can actually save the day. She teleports the Phalanx away, leaving her new friends safe.</p><h3>Life Signs (Chapter Two)</h3><p>At Mont St. Francis, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\" href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" slug=\"professor-x\">Professor Xavier</a> has assembled the collective teams of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-14864\" href=\"/excalibur/4060-14864/\" slug=\"excalibur\">Excalibur</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4060-24131\" href=\"/x-factor/4060-24131/\" slug=\"x-factor\">X-Factor</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4060-15595\" href=\"/x-force/4060-15595/\" slug=\"x-force\">X-Force</a>. He alerts the teams of the Phalanx threat, having started when the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40563\" href=\"/friends-of-humanity/4060-40563/\" slug=\"friends-of-humanity\">Friends of Humanity</a> got a hold of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7223\" href=\"/warlock/4005-7223/\" slug=\"warlock\">Warlock</a>'s remains. They initially wanted to use the remains as a way to change humans into a way to be the next breed of Sentinels, but the hosts became a part of the collective and the Phalanx evolved faster than the humans had intended. Instead of finding a way to eliminate the mutant threat, the Phalanx grew to trying to eradicate life on Earth.</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-4557\" href=\"/wolfsbane/4005-4557/\" slug=\"wolfsbane\">Wolfsbane</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1496\" href=\"/cannonball/4005-1496/\" slug=\"cannonball\">Cannonball</a> hear of the incarceration of Douglock and go to inspect him to see if he is a reanimated <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14559\" href=\"/cypher/4005-14559/\" slug=\"cypher\">Doug Ramsey</a>. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4279\" href=\"/forge/4005-4279/\" slug=\"forge\">Forge</a> joins them and sees the wonder of a new life form, as Douglock is a being that has broken off the Phalanx collective. Douglock then kidnaps the three visitors and takes them to Italy where the Phalanx has built a spire to communicate to the originators of the Phalanx. Douglock, Cannonball, and Wolfsbane travel to the top of the tower in hopes of jamming the signal to the stars.</p><p>Meanwhile, a Phalanx leader has turned Forge's mutant power against himself. Forge is shown the glory of bringing on a new race and he is unable to stop himself from caring for the incubators of the Phalanx. The incubators hold the next generation of Phalanx, a fail-safe in case the transmission isn't able to get through to the Phalanx originators. Fortunately, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1461\" href=\"/nightcrawler/4005-1461/\" slug=\"nightcrawler\">Nightcrawler</a> is able to talk Forge into rebooting how Forge's mutant power operates and Forge is able to destroy the incubators. At this point, Douglock supposedly sacrifices himself by throwing himself onto the beam to space. The Phalanx is undone and breaks down. Douglock survives, however, since he has things left to live for.</p><h3>Final Sanction (Chapter Three)</h3><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\" href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" slug=\"cyclops\">Cyclops</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\" href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" slug=\"jean-grey\">Jean Grey</a> return from their honeymoon to find the X-Men have been kidnapped. They head to Muir Island to meet up with the Professor and find out how they can help; instead they find the island overrun with Phalanx. The Professor, however, had sent a message to both <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\" href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" slug=\"wolverine\">Wolverine</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2157\" href=\"/cable/4005-2157/\" slug=\"cable\">Cable</a> before leaving the island and the two meet up with Cyclops and Jean Grey in time to prevent the Phalanx from getting their hands on <a data-ref-id=\"4005-8304\" href=\"/moira-mactaggert/4005-8304/\" slug=\"moira-mactaggert\">Moira MacTaggert</a>'s research. The research is needed so that the Phalanx can learn how to assimilate mutants into their collective. To stop the Phalanx, Cable and Jean stage a psionic assault on the Astral Plane while Cyclops and Wolverine sneak in and take the information. The mutants learn that the Phalanx collective is located in Tibet, blow up Moira's laboratory, and head to finally eradicate the Phalanx threat.</p><p>In Tibet, Stephen Lang has realized that the Phalanx has gotten out of hand. He wants mutants eradicated, but he sees that humanity will suffer, as well. He constructs a plan that he hopes will stop Cameron Hodge and the Phalanx for good. Oddly enough, his plan involves the X-Men. He talks <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3176\" href=\"/psylocke/4005-3176/\" slug=\"psylocke\">Psylocke</a> into being his mole. She is \"assimilated\" and is able to regain her mind when given the command to attack the other X-Men. This comes to pass when Wolverine gets passed the Phalanx defenses, puts a small hole in <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1503\" href=\"/bishop/4005-1503/\" slug=\"bishop\">Bishop</a>'s energy containment chamber, and gives Bishop an energy source. Blasting the X-Men out, the Phalanx citadel is taken down. While Lang thinks he's pulled himself out of the danger and in a position to further his quest of mutant genocide, Hodge pulls Lang into the collapsing citadel.</p><h2>Effects</h2><p>The next generation of mutants would form a group called <a data-ref-id=\"4060-15083\" href=\"/generation-x/4060-15083/\" slug=\"generation-x\">Generation X</a> and be led by Banshee and Emma Frost.</p><p>Due to the combined psi-attack of Jean Grey and Cable, Cable is able to catch some hints as to who Slym and Redd (the couple who raised him) actually were.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-37479\" href=\"/generation-x-classic/4050-37479/\" slug=\"generation-x-classic\">Generation X Classic</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-22011\" href=\"/origin-of-generation-x/4050-22011/\" slug=\"origin-of-generation-x\">Origin of Generation X</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-264307\" href=\"/essential-x-men-the-phalanx-covenant-begins/4000-264307/\" slug=\"essential-x-men-the-phalanx-covenant-begins\">Essential X-Men #18</a> (UK)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-264345\" href=\"/essential-x-men-the-phalanx-covenant-part-two/4000-264345/\" slug=\"essential-x-men-the-phalanx-covenant-part-two\">Essential X-Men #19</a> (UK)</li></ul>",

They capture several members of the X-Men and New Mutants, namely <a href=\"/storm/4005-1444/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1444\">Storm</a>, <a href=\"/wolfsbane/4005-4557/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4557\">Wolfsbane</a>, <a href=\"/boom-boom/4005-2159/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2159\">Boom Boom</a>, and <a href=\"/rictor/4005-10988/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10988\">Rictor</a>. They also kill <a href=\"/warlock/4005-7223/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7223\">Warlock</a>. After becoming mutates, Storm and Wolfsbane end up brainwashed like Havok. <a href=\"/mutates/4005-28504/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28504\">Mutates</a>, like the three of them, are slaves on the island nation of <a href=\"/genosha/4020-40967/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40967\">Genosha</a> and dominated by an elite human minority similar to apartheid. Several mutant groups from around the world gather and travel to Genosha in order to rescue their friends. They include the remaining New Mutants lead by <a href=\"/cable/4005-2157/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2157\">Cable</a>, X-Factor, and X-Men members previously scattered across the globe.</p><p>Once in Genosha, many of them end up captured as well, including <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a> and <a href=\"/gambit/4005-1499/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1499\">Gambit</a>. <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops</a> manages to reach Havok, and helps his brother overcome his brainwashing. At the opportune moment, Havok turns on his master, Cameron Hodge, enabling others to revolt as well. Cameron Hodge is beheaded and then buried alive by Rictor, who also causes the Genoshan capital building (known as the Citadel) to collapse onto Hodge's remains. In the wake of the battle, Havok and Wolfsbane decide to stay in Genosha in order to help rebuild the country and protect the mutant population.</p><h2>Effects</h2><h3>X-Men</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/229/665794-5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-665794\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4\" data-width=\"280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:140.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/229/665794-5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-665794\"><img alt=\"The New Betsy\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/229/665794-5.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/229/665794-5.jpg 280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px\" data-width=\"280\"></a><figcaption>The New Betsy</figcaption></figure><p>Storm was programmed by the <a href=\"/genegineer-david-moreau/4005-28470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28470\">Genegineer</a> to snap out of her mutate state with the ability to restore a mutant's power by touch. This is first manifested when she restores Cyclops's power after the trial. A side effect of coming out of her mutate condition was that Storm once again possessed an adult body and could control her powers more fully. Also, the rest of the X-Men get to see the new <a href=\"/psylocke/4005-3176/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3176\">Betsy Braddock</a>. Havok stays in Genosha so as to help rebuild the country and to see that the mutates are dealt with in a humane way.</p><h3>X-Factor</h3><p>During the events of the X-Tinction Agenda, Wolverine lay dying in a cell. <a href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\">Jean Grey</a> had been placed in this cell as well and the two shared a moment of intimacy. This scene further showed the confusion Jean feels concerning the emotional bond she has with both Wolverine and Cyclops. Cyclops is shown to acknowledge that his hold on Jean is strained, at best, and tried to rein her in during some key elements of various battles. Jean showed that she still had a mind of her own and could help in whatever way would be best for the teams.</p><h3>New Mutants</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29818/679597-wolfsbane18.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-679597\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"2.5547445255474\" data-width=\"137\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 137px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:255.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29818/679597-wolfsbane18.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-679597\"><img alt=\"Mutate Rahne\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29818/679597-wolfsbane18.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29818/679597-wolfsbane18.jpg 137w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 137px) 100vw, 137px\" data-width=\"137\"></a><figcaption>Mutate Rahne</figcaption></figure><p>The team most influenced by the events of the X-Tinction Agenda. In an attempt to rescue his friends, Warlock de-powered their cell and allowed himself to be captured. This ultimately led to Cameron Hodge trying to assimilate the transmode virus, which would allow him to shift his shape. Rahne stopped the process but it was too late for Warlock. He became the only one to die at during these events. His ashes would later be spread on Doug Ramsey's grave.</p><p>In trying to stop Hodge from taking Warlock's power, Rahne herself was captured and turned into Mutate 20. Even after Storm touched her, if Rahne stayed in her human form she would still be a mindless mutate since her suit was bonded to her. She did, however, gain even more power in her wolf form. The Genegineer explained that all Rahne's former inhibitions were taken away and her mutant powers would evidence this. True to form, Rahne's lycanthropic form was far more fierce and difficult to calm. Rahne decided to leave the New Mutants and stay in Genosha to help with its rebuilding process.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/x-men-x-tinction-agenda/4050-41405/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-41405\">X-Men: X-Tinction Agenda</a> Trade (2001)</li><li><a href=\"/essential-x-men-volume-10/4000-323368/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-323368\">Essential X-Men #10</a></li></ul><h2>Related Issues</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/x-men-programma-extinctione/4050-36643/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-36643\">X-Men: Programma Extinctione</a></li><li><a href=\"/x-men-the-ultra-collection-book-2-of-5/4000-70492/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-70492\">X-Men: The Ultra Collection #2</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/coleccionable-x-men-18/4000-286109/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-286109\">Coleccionable X-Men #18</a> (Spanish)</li><li><a href=\"/coleccionable-x-men-19/4000-286110/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-286110\">Coleccionable X-Men #19</a> (Spanish)</li><li><a href=\"/coleccionable-x-men-20/4000-286111/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-286111\">Coleccionable X-Men #20</a> (Spanish)</li></ul>",

After all, he did use the same stuff to form <a href=\"/archangel/4005-2112/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2112\">Archangel</a>'s wings, as well as infect the son of Cyclops in the <a href=\"/endgame/4045-55862/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55862\">Endgame</a> story arc. The team reluctantly agrees and Apocalypse (after regenerating) cures the Professor by accelerating the infection. With the virus out, the Professor sleeps deeply. The remaining members of the X-Men, Apocalypse included, head to the Moon.</p><p>Cable, Bishop and Wolverine are already on the Moon and under heavy attack. The X-Teams show up in time to help defeat the Dark Riders. The teams then spread out to find Cyclops and Jean, as well as Stryfe. Stryfe, meanwhile, has recaptured Cyclops and Jean and removed them to different location. Cable, <a href=\"/havok/4005-3546/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3546\">Havok</a>, <a href=\"/polaris/4005-1473/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1473\">Polaris</a>, and <a href=\"/cannonball/4005-1496/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1496\">Cannonball</a> track Stryfe to a building but a gray force field only lets those in of Summers blood. Cable then fights Stryfe. Losing, Cable is able to find relief from Havok, who made it through. With the assault on Stryfe, Cyclops and Jean are able to break free of Stryfe's hold and help in the fight. Cable knows the only way to finish the fight is to take Stryfe out for good, which means taking himself out, too. Cyclops triggers the mechanism that opens a portal into which Stryfe and Cable are pulled to their supposed deaths. Cyclops doesn't know for sure, but he can't help but feel as if he's let his son go again.</p><p>Mr. Sinister is finally seen to open a canister, his payment for the part he played in Stryfe's game. Instead of the promised genetic make-up of the Summers family, the canister is supposedly empty.</p><h2>Effects</h2><h3>X-Men</h3><p>Xavier could walk again, albeit briefly, due to the effects of the techno-organic virus. <a href=\"/rogue/4005-1446/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1446\">Rogue</a> was blinded by the MLF member <a href=\"/strobe/4005-27418/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27418\">Strobe</a>. The effects would only last a few weeks, but that time was spent mostly around <a href=\"/gambit/4005-1499/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1499\">Gambit</a>.</p><h3>X-Force</h3><p>Cannonball stepped up and took the reigns of leadership of the team.</p><h3>Mutant Liberation Front</h3><p>Each mutant member not killed is arrested (except <a href=\"/zero/4005-14859/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14859\">Zero</a>). Only some are released when <a href=\"/reignfire/4005-15520/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15520\">Reignfire</a> later restarts the MLF.</p><h3>Cable and Stryfe</h3><p>Both men were seemingly lost into the vortex. Cable later returns, but Stryfe's mind is locked into Cable's brain. He resurfaces at later times but is always defeated.</p><h3>Mutants in General</h3><p>The canister Mr. Sinister opened wasn't empty. It actually contained the <a href=\"/legacy-virus/4015-42281/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-42281\">Legacy Virus</a>, a disease that largely only affected mutants.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/x-factor-visionaries-peter-david-volume-four/4000-222635/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-222635\">X-Factor Visionaries: Peter David Vol. 4</a></li><li><a href=\"/x-men-x-cutioners-song/4050-42940/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-42940\">X-Men: X-Cutioner's Song</a></li></ul><h2>Related Items</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/marvel-age-/4000-157250/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-157250\">Marvel Age #116</a></li><li><a href=\"/stryfes-strike-file/4050-18149/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18149\">Stryfe's Strike File</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/what-if-69-what-if-stryfe-killed-the-x-men/4000-40329/\">What If...? #69 - What if Stryfe Killed the X-Men</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/coleccionable-marvel-heroes-43-la-patrulla-x-la-ca/4000-612251/\">Coleccionable Marvel Héroes - La Patrulla-X: La canción del verdugo</a> (Spanish)</li><li><a href=\"/coleccionable-x-men-35/4000-286126/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-286126\">Coleccionable X-Men #35</a> (Spanish)</li><li><a href=\"/coleccionable-x-men-36/4000-286127/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-286127\">Coleccionable X-Men #36</a> (Spanish)</li><li><a href=\"/coleccionable-x-men-37/4000-286128/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-286128\">Coleccionable X-Men #37</a> (Spanish)</li><li><a href=\"/coleccionable-x-men-38/4000-286129/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-286129\">Coleccionable X-Men #38</a> (Spanish)</li></ul>",

    "description": "<p>This larger story arc \"The Dark Phoenix Saga\" is broken up into two parts. The first part is <a href=\"/phoenix-saga/4045-56154/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56154\">The Phoenix Saga</a> in (X-Men #101-108). This is the second part of the two-part series mostly taking place in X-Men #129-138.</p><h2>The Creation of the Dark Phoenix Saga</h2><p>The Dark Phoenix Saga was created because of the number of fans that loved the original <a href=\"/phoenix-saga/4050-33984/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-33984\">Phoenix Saga</a>. Marvel needed a way to bring the Phoenix back in a way like never before, so they decided to have the Phoenix come back to earth evil. They figured what better way to shock the readers than to have the once great and powerful balance maker turn evil and show its true colors. This idea resulted in the creation of the Dark Phoenix Saga.</p><h3>How it Started</h3><p>After taking some time off to find herself, Jean Grey journeyed to Muir Island. While shopping she met a strange man named <a href=\"/mastermind/4005-8306/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8306\">Jason Wyngarde</a>, who was secretly the old X-men villain \"Mastermind\". After Mastermind toyed with Jean's mind, she decided to stay on Muir Island so that Moira MacTaggart could test the full extent of her new powers. During an emergency alarm concerning Moira's son <a href=\"/proteus/4005-2165/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2165\">Proteus</a>, Jean was swept up in an illusion of herself in the 1800's as Lady Jean Grey (an ancestor of Jean's). <a href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\">Lady Jean Grey</a> was the wife of the era's Jason Wyngarde and Black Queen of the Hellfire Club at that time. This psychic illusion caught her off guard and she was felled by Proteus. Later during the Proteus situation, Mastermind once again took Jean into his 19th Century illusion where he convinced her that a cruel game of manhunt was her own idea!</p><p>Following the defeat of Proteus Jean returned to the mansion and very quickly got reports of 2 new mutants, <a href=\"/kitty-pryde/4005-3548/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3548\">Kitty Pryde</a> and <a href=\"/dazzler/4005-1498/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1498\">Dazzler</a>. The team decided it would be best to split up and look for the two mutants, Jean decided to search for Dazzler. When Jean researched Dazzler's last known location, she found that Dazzler worked at a nearby club so she decided to look there first. At the club where they find Dazzler was performing Jean once again saw Jason Wyngarde walking across the floor and was instantly brought back into the illusion where she was his wife. While in the illusion <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops's</a> face appears and Jean is able to break free from it. While Jean walked out of the club, Jason sends Hellfire grunts after her and in little time, they are all defeated.</p><p>During the assault, Wyngarde brought Jean into one last illusion where she was the Black Queen and helped him along with the Inner Circle take down the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-men</a>. After that she then and took her place as their new Black Queen.</p><h3>Dark Phoenix Saga</h3><p>Jean Grey's powers were increasing it began to corrupt her and make her want more and more energy which caused Jean to develop a split-personality. At first Jean was able to control it but as time went on it became harder and harder to control. Mastermind wanted to join the Hellfire Club and captured Jean Grey by using her hunger to his advantage. Mastermind made Jean think she was in the 18th century by using hallucinations and in time, she became the “<a href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\">Black Queen</a>”.</p><p>In attempt to save Jean, the X-Men were captured and chained up in the corner of the dining room. When the Hellfire Club was sitting at the table for supper Emma Frost saw Jean’s puzzled face and soon realized what was going on. She knew that Cyclops was trying to connect to Jean Grey through their telepathic connection (which only Scott and Jean shared). Emma ordered that Mastermind do something at once. Mastermind then had a telepathic battle with Cyclops inside of Jean Grey’s mind and in the end Mastermind killed Cyclops, making the real Jean Grey heartbroken. Jean reassumed control over her body and powers for a short amount of time but when the Phoenix retook control of her body she became overwhelmed with madness. The Phoenix broke free of Mastermind's illusion. Confused and angry the Dark Phoenix turned itself into a bird-like form of pure fire, and stated “No one can control the power of the Phoenix!\" and burst through the ceiling and flew to the roof. Mastermind followed her to the roof in hopes that he would still be able to control her, but soon learned that he was no match for the mighty Phoenix.</p><p>When the Phoenix was done with Mastermind, Cyclops got to the roof and called out Jean Grey’s name. That upset the Dark Phoenix so much that she broke out and yelled, “The mortal Jean Grey is no more, I am the Dark Phoenix!\". The Phoenix then felt Jean Grey retake her body once again (only for a few seconds) but manages to say the words, \"Scott, Help Me\". When the Dark Phoenix retook control, she shot a fire ball at them which blew the X-Men into a nearby park.</p><p>The Dark Phoenix then flew over to the park and told the X-Men that their destinies had come to an end and that the Dark Phoenix had come to destroy them all. Then the battle began and in the end, the X-Men lost. Cyclops (being the last to go down) was hit the hardest because he had upset the Dark Phoenix the most, mainly because he confused her. When the Dark Phoenix asked Cyclops why he had cared about the body of Jean Grey so much, he replied, “I love her”. That statement made the Dark Phoenix upset because she didn’t understand or know what the emotion felt like, so she replied, “I do not understand, your answer is unacceptable” and used a force-field to wipe him out. When Cyclops was knocked out Jean Grey retook control of her body again (this time for a longer period of time) and walked over to Cyclops’s body and started to cry.</p><p>She then said, “Don’t ever forget Scott, I will always love you.” The Dark Phoenix resumed control and became madder than ever and took the form of an enormous bird made out of pure fire. This figure was seen for hundreds and hundreds of miles. The Dark Phoenix then flew straight up into the sky until she was no longer seen. The waves of power that the Dark Phoenix gave off when she transformed into the birdlike shape were sensed by extremely powerful telepaths throughout the universe, each one showed an extremely puzzled face.</p><p>The Dark Phoenix then entered space and created a black hole to teleport into another galaxy (D’Bari Galaxy). The Dark Phoenix dove into the D’Bari’s star and started to feed on its energy until there was nothing left but a nova.</p><p>When the Shi’ar tried to attack the Dark Phoenix she then turned around and attacked back, but with little effort, luckily not destroying the Shi’ar but causing more than enough to damage to give them the hint to back off. The Dark Phoenix then flew back to earth causing the captain in charge of the spacecraft to contact the empress and give her the warning. Meanwhile when all of this was going on, Beast was creating a machine that would neutralize the power of the Dark Phoenix, but only for an extremely short period of time. Once created Beast tried to figure out where the Dark Phoenix could be headed next but had no trouble figuring it out.</p><p>Beast along with all the other X-Men (including <a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Xavier</a>) went to Jean Grey’s childhood home and waited for her to arrive. When she arrived Xavier tried to fool the Dark Phoenix by putting hallucinations into her head, making her think that her parents are sitting in the drive way waiting for her. Once Jean walked outside, the car started to pull away causing Jean to go farther and farther into the yard as she chased after it. When she was far enough, the X-Men made their move and with some luck Beast slipped the device onto Dark Phoenix’s head. At first it looked like it was working, the Dark Phoenix had fallen to the ground in pain, but after a few short seconds the Phoenix stood up and melted the device. The Dark Phoenix then became overwhelmed with rage, she laughed and taunted Beast for his failure. Dark Phoenix picked up the X-Men with her telekinetic powers, by this time it looked like the X-Men had finally came to their end, but then out of nowhere Xavier tries his best to invade the mind of the Dark Phoenix and successes. He then summoned the Dark Phoenix to a telepathic battle.</p><p>Dark Phoenix knows that Xavier is no match for her, so she decides to taunt and play around a little bit. He tries his best to defeat her, but once the Dark Phoenix had had enough she then decided to destroy him. She had almost succeeded, but Xavier called for the help of Jean Grey herself (who is in a way trapped within her own body) just in time. Together with the two extremely powerful telepaths working together, they are able to bind the Dark Phoenix into her own powers, but only for the time being.</p><p>Since the Dark Phoenix had been contained, Jean Grey was able to retake control of her body once again. Once she awoke, Jean Grey was greeted home by all her fellow X-Men. It seemed like everything had just fallen back into place. Then the Shi’ar arrived and tried to take Jean Grey away so that they could destroy her and the evil, powerful creature that was within her to ensure the universe’s safety. The empress then ordered her Imperial Guards to capture Jean. The X-Men got ready for the battle of their lives and were willing to do anything to protect Jean. Luckily for them Xavier was able to enter the mind of the empress and found out that if the Imperial Guards were challenged to a battle, they must accept it. The X-Men were then brought onto the spacecraft and were taken into space. On board, Jean Grey was accused of genocide and the only solution was death. The X-Men and the Shi’ar agreed that there would be a battle and the winner would determine Jean Grey’s fate. Once the X-Men had gotten ready they along with the Imperial Guards were then teleported to a moon where the battle would take place.</p><p>The X-Men (not knowing they were no match for the Imperial Guards) then decided to split up into pairs. After many hours of battle Jean Grey and Scott Summers were the last two left in the match. Before the two decided to give the Imperial Guards the best they had, Jean and Scott hid in a nearby cave to say their last few words before they fought for their lives. When they were done they ran out and were confronted by all of the Imperial Guards. Jean and Scott were doing great until Scott was shot down. The sight of Jean Grey’s true love falling to the ground put so much guilt and stress on her that the Dark Phoenix was able to retake control of the body once again. By doing so she sent off extremely powerful waves of power which knock off the energy flow of the Shi’ar spacecraft.</p><p>The Dark Phoenix then went after the Imperial Guards and had them feel the wraith of the Dark Phoenix. Once the Imperial Guards were out of the picture Jean Grey had retaken control of the powers and body. She knew that her control over the Dark Phoenix was not going to last long and right under the Shi’ar spacecraft. She then used her powers to boost the spacecraft’s weapon system. Thinking that the Shi’ar’s weapon was powerful enough to kill her and the Dark Phoenix she said her farewell to Scott by saying, “I love you Scott, don’t ever forget, I will always be with you.” The empress blasted the weapon directly at the Dark Phoenix. During the blast the Dark Phoenix had retaken control of the body forming once again the shape of the fire bird, then it was gone.</p><p>Thinking that the Phoenix was destroyed, the empress then teleported herself and Xavier to the moon. She apologized to Scott along with the other X-Men. Then out of nowhere the Phoenix rose from her ashes as the Phoenix Force and brought Jean Grey’s body with her. The Phoenix then apologized to all the X-Men. She explained to them how she lost her way and assured them all that it would never happen again. When Scott asked what would happen to Jean, the Phoenix Force told him that the flame within her was no more, but that with a small portion from many would be enough to restore the life within Jean Grey. The X-Men accepted the deal and they all grouped together and watched as a small part of each of them went into Jean Grey. The Phoenix then said, “I have been here too long, I must depart” and flew away. When Jean woke up, the first thing she said was Scott’s name and the saga ended with Jean Grey kissing Scott Summers.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/x-men-dark-phoenix-saga/4050-40248/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-40248\">X-Men: Dark Phoenix Saga</a></li><li><a href=\"/x-men-the-dark-phoenix-saga/4050-30096/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-30096\">X-Men: The Dark Phoenix Saga</a></li><li><a href=\"/x-men-legends-vol-2-the-dark-phoenix-saga/4050-44329/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-44329\">X-Men Legends Vol. 2: The Dark Phoenix Saga</a></li><li><a href=\"/essential-x-men-volume-2/4000-140971/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-140971\">Essential X-Men Volume 2</a></li><li><a href=\"/marvel-masterworks-the-uncanny-x-men-volume-four/4000-233668/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-233668\">Marvel Masterworks: The Uncanny X-Men Volume 4</a> &amp; <a href=\"/marvel-masterworks-the-uncanny-x-men-volume-five/4000-233671/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-233671\">Volume 5</a></li><li><a href=\"/uncanny-x-men-omnibus/4050-27512/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-27512\">Uncanny X-Men Omnibus</a></li></ul><h2>Related Issues</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/what-if-what-if-phoenix-had-not-died/4000-21393/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-21393\">What If? #27</a></li><li><a href=\"/x-men-messiah-complex-mutant-files/4050-25193/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-25193\">Men: Messiah Complex - Mutant Files</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/coleccionable-marvel-heroes-4-la-patrulla-x-la-sag/4000-612206/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-612206\">Coleccionable Marvel Héroes: La Patrulla-X: La saga de Fénix Oscura</a> (Spanish) </li></ul>",

    "description": "<h2>Plot Summary</h2><p>The Infinity Gauntlet is a six issue miniseries written by <a href=\"/jim-starlin/4040-7922/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-7922\">Jim Starlin</a>, penciled by <a href=\"/george-perez/4040-2913/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-2913\">George Perez</a> and inked by <a href=\"/ron-lim/4040-3258/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-3258\">Ron Lim</a> published in 1991.</p><p>Mistress <a href=\"/death/4005-12620/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12620\">Death</a> is upset that the balance between life and death has recently not been in her favor. Her solution is to give her ardent follower, <a href=\"/thanos/4005-7607/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\">Thanos</a>, a chance at rebirth setting him forth with a mission of killing half the life in the universe. Despite his powers, Thanos realizes his mission is near impossible. Remembering the <a href=\"/infinity-gems/4055-41041/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41041\">Infinity Gems</a> that were instrumental in his death, he peered into the Infinity Well to discover their secrets. He divines the true nature of the gems, and their current owners.</p><h3>The Thanos Quest</h3><p>Thanos discovers that the Infinity Gems are currently in possession of the <a href=\"/elders-of-the-universe/4060-41142/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41142\">Elders of the Universe</a> with the Soul Gem in possession of the <a href=\"/in-betweener/4005-13354/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13354\">In-Betweener</a>. With cunning, Thanos is able to obtain possession of the gems. He then places the gems on the <a href=\"/infinity-gauntlet/4055-40945/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40945\">Infinity Gauntlet</a>, and becomes the most powerful being in the universe.</p><h3>The Infinity Gauntlet</h3><p>Thanos immediately fulfills his objective and kills half of all life in the universe. He also brings a tortured <a href=\"/nebula/4005-14558/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14558\">Nebula</a> (who alleges to be his granddaughter) as a sacrifice to Death. But because Thanos is so powerful, becoming superior to Death in every facet, Thanos' hope of being treated as an equal escapes his grasp. He gleans from Death that they are not equal, and Death becomes subservient to him. This infuriates Thanos who doesn't want Death as a slave but as a lover. In an attempt to make Death jealous, he creates a mate, <a href=\"/terraxia/4005-28004/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28004\">Terraxia</a>.</p><p>On earth, the heroes are informed by the <a href=\"/silver-surfer/4005-2502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\">Silver Surfer</a> as to the reason for the monumental genocide. All of Marvel's mightiest heroes band together to try to defeat Thanos and save the universe. Despite previous conflicts with the Mad Titan, Thanos still remains a mystery. <a href=\"/adam-warlock/4005-6805/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6805\">Adam Warlock</a>, one of Thanos' most persistent foes, is asked to lead the forces.</p><p>Knowing full well the impossible odds, Adam Warlock and Silver Surfer attempt cosmic diplomacy in the hopes of thwarting Thanos. The two heroes meet up with <a href=\"/epoch/4005-6143/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6143\">Epoch</a> and her cosmic champion <a href=\"/quasar/4005-3319/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3319\">Quasar</a> and a cosmic summit of the great cosmic powers begins. It includes <a href=\"/eternity/4005-11332/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11332\">Eternity</a>, the <a href=\"/watcher/4005-7120/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7120\">Watcher</a> Uatu, <a href=\"/kronos/4005-28005/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28005\">Kronos</a>, <a href=\"/lord-chaos/4005-12903/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12903\">Lord Chaos</a>, <a href=\"/master-order/4005-12904/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12904\">Master Order</a>, the <a href=\"/celestials/4060-13343/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13343\">Celestials</a>, <a href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\">Galactus</a>, <a href=\"/stranger/4005-13332/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13332\">Stranger</a>, <a href=\"/love/4005-28006/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28006\">Love</a> and <a href=\"/hate/4005-28007/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28007\">Hate</a> and the <a href=\"/living-tribunal/4005-6811/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6811\">Living Tribunal</a>. In the summit Eternity tries to convince the Living Tribunal to intervene. The Living Tribunal refuses, in since he believes that if Thanos were to replace Eternity it would still be within the process in natural selection. After seeing this, Adam Warlock persuades the Cosmic powers to aid them in stopping Thanos.</p><p>Thanos is fully aware of the coming conflict. <a href=\"/mephisto/4005-2635/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2635\">Mephisto</a> arrives and advises Thanos to remove his omniscience to make the fight somewhat fair in the hopes of impressing Death. Despite the machinations of Mephisto, the battle is grueling and over quickly for the heroes. Thanos dispatched the heroes with ease. Some examples of the carnage include Terraxia murdering <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man</a> and decapitating <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man</a>. The X-men fared no better, as Wolverine had his adamantium skeleton turned to spongy rubber and <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops</a> had his head trapped in a cube, stopping his optic blasts and suffocating him. Cosmic heroes like <a href=\"/nova/4005-2105/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2105\">Nova</a> was turned into small cubes, and with <a href=\"/quasar/4005-3319/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3319\">Quasar</a>, Thanos causes the <a href=\"/quantum-bands/4055-42361/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-42361\">Quantum Bands</a> upon his wrists to explode and then disintegrated him. Fearsome foes like Thor were turned to glass. The last man standing was <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a>, who made his last stand. Absent from the battle and light years away were the Silver Surfer and Adam Warlock, who knew and fully expected the frontal assault to fail. The key to the real strategy was Mephisto's involvement. After shattering Captain America's shield, Thanos raised his fist to deliver the final blow. This was the cue for Adam Warlock's true plan to go into effect as Surfer rushed in to steal the gauntlet. This gambit failed, and Thanos realized how close he was to failure himself. He once again reinstated his omniscience, and became all-powerful, all-knowing once again.</p><p>It was then that the Cosmic forces themselves attacked. The mighty forces, each near-omnipotent on their own, were no match for the omnipotence the Infinity Gauntlet bestowed upon Thanos. Eternity and Thanos had a final epic battle where Thanos perseveres, becoming the embodiment of this universe's reality. Thanos sheds his mortal form and takes his place Eternity's replacement. Nebula seizes this opportunity to take the gauntlet from the former body of Thanos. Thanos realizes his error and joins with the remaining heroes and cosmic forces to defeat the now omnipotent Nebula. Their relentless attack on the confused Gauntlet wielder allows Adam Warlock to enter the Soul Gem, a gem he is intimately attached to. From within the Soul Gem he links with the other Infinity Gems and causes the gems to feedback on Nebula, causing her to remove it.</p><p>Adam Warlock then becomes wielder of the Gauntlet. In an attempt to be a \"perfect\" god, Warlock's first use of the power was to expel from his soul the Good and Evil. This was the first step to his reign as God. But before he can begin, the Living Tribunal appears and deems Warlock too unstable and therefore unfit to wield the power. He didn't appear previously because he knew that Thanos wouldn't upset the delicate balance of the universe. Without morals or vices, with his sole focus of being a god being undermined, Warlock violently reacts to the Living Tribunal's judgment. The Living Tribunal dismisses Warlock's uses of the Gauntlet and deems that they would no longer be able to function together, preventing anyone from achieving omnipotence through possession of the gems. The gems separate, and Adam Warlock forms <a href=\"/infinity-watch/4060-25623/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-25623\">Infinity Watch</a> to safeguard the powerful and dangerous <a href=\"/infinity-gems/4055-41041/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41041\">Infinity Gems</a>. Thanos retreats to a life of farming to reflect on his life, death, and brush with godhood.</p><h2>Reading Order</h2><h3>Prologue</h3><ol><li><a

    "description": "<p>After having his telepathic affair with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1457\" href=\"/emma-frost/4005-1457/\" slug=\"emma-frost\">Emma Frost</a> discovered by his wife <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\" href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" slug=\"jean-grey\">Jean Grey</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\" href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" slug=\"cyclops\">Cyclops</a> leaves the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41138\" href=\"/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/4020-41138/\" slug=\"xavier-institute-for-higher-learning\">Xavier Institute for Higher Learning</a> and the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\" href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" slug=\"x-men\">X-Men</a>. Not knowing what to do, he goes to the Hellfire Club to watch the exotic dancers and get drunk. What he doesn't expect to find there is <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\" href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" slug=\"wolverine\">Wolverine</a>. Wolverine invites him to do some \"serious drinking\", and turns it into a wager. If Scott can out-drink Wolverine then he can get back to doing whatever he wanted to do. If Wolverine wins Scott needs to help him out with a mission. Wolverine had arrived with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4281\" href=\"/fantomex/4005-4281/\" slug=\"fantomex\">Fantomex</a>, who had promised to help him uncover the truth behind their origin and the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40591\" href=\"/weapon-plus/4060-40591/\" slug=\"weapon-plus\">Weapon Plus</a> program. Wolverine tracked down Scott to help them. Scott lost the wager and passes out.</p><p>Cyclops, Wolverine, and Fantomex arrive to Weapon Plus's <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41078\" href=\"/the-world/4020-41078/\" slug=\"the-world\">The World</a> to find that someone had already been there before them. The remains of a team of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-13497\" href=\"/aim/4060-13497/\" slug=\"aim\">A.I.M</a> agents is all over the place and the only remaining member is not in a position to tell them much. Fantomex deduces that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41077\" href=\"/ultimaton/4005-41077/\" slug=\"ultimaton\">Ultimaton</a> (Weapon XV) had killed the agents. He explains that within The World time is artificial, and can be sped up, slowed down, or stopped completely. The inhabitants of The World were engineered from biological creatures as well as micro-sentinel technology. Speeding up time within The World and regular Gamma radiation bombardment allowed Weapon Plus to artificially stimulate evolution within the inhabitants. Their goal was to create super-human soldiers to fight in the pending war between humanity and mutant kind.</p><p>Fantomex pauses time within The World and they venture inside the dome to locate Weapon IV. It has not been long on the outside since Fantomex escaped The World, but inside the dome generations had passed. Within the world they saw World Police Cars driven by whale brains, and massive destruction. All of the other inhabitants of the world were killed by Weapon XV. The doors to the world slam shut as the last surviving agent of the A.I.M. raid turns time within The World back on, releasing Weapon XV from stasis. The three are able to find XV quickly, but are of little use against him. Fantomex signals for <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45709\" href=\"/eva/4005-45709/\" slug=\"eva\">E.V.A</a> to regain control of The World from the A.I.M. agent, but when she gets to the controls she realizes that Weapon XV has locked her out. After beating Wolverine, Cyclops, and Fantomex in combat, Weapon XV smashes out of The World, freeing himself.</p><p>Within E.V.A. they tracked Ultimaton to a nearly completed space-station orbiting around the Earth. Within they found the records of the Weapon Plus program, as well as its plans. The Super-Sentinels that were Weapon XII through XV were designed to rid the world of mutants. Within the station EVA was captured by Weapon Plus, and killed. Wolverine had read the files about himself and those that came before him, learning that the Weapon Plus program started back in World War II with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\" href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" slug=\"captain-america\">Captain America</a>: Weapon I. Wolverine also discovered that there was a traitor within the mansion, someone sent to infiltrate them. Ultimaton found Wolverine and before he could do anything Wolverine triggered the auto-destruct for the station. Cyclops and Fantomex are able to escape in one of the planes.</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\" href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" slug=\"professor-x\">Professor X</a> uses <a data-ref-id=\"4055-15073\" href=\"/cerebro/4055-15073/\" slug=\"cerebro\">Cerebro</a> to find Wolverine is still in space. The explosion had thrown them into a nearby asteroid near the course of the satellite. Jean Grey takes one of the X-Planes to rescue Logan. She finds him destroying Weapon XV, and recognizes that the asteroid they are on is no ordinary satellite, it is <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\" href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" slug=\"magneto\">Magneto</a>'s former base <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41752\" href=\"/asteroid-m/4020-41752/\" slug=\"asteroid-m\">Asteroid M</a>.</p><h2>Related Story-Arcs</h2><p><a data-ref-id=\"4045-50499\" href=\"/murder-at-the-mansion/4045-50499/\" slug=\"murder-at-the-mansion\">Murder at the Mansion</a> - The events that took place before Assault on Weapon Plus, including the attempt on Emma Frost's life.</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4045-50498\" href=\"/planet-x/4045-50498/\" slug=\"planet-x\">Planet X</a> - The events of Assault on Weapon Plus are continued through the Planet X story-arc.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-30253\" href=\"/new-x-men-assault-on-weapon-plus/4050-30253/\" slug=\"new-x-men-assault-on-weapon-plus\">New X-Men: Assault On Weapon Plus</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-295218\" href=\"/new-x-men-by-grant-morrison-book-6/4000-295218/\" slug=\"new-x-men-by-grant-morrison-book-6\">New X-Men By Grant Morrison Book 6</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-186307\" href=\"/new-x-men-ultimate-collection-book-3/4000-186307/\" slug=\"new-x-men-ultimate-collection-book-3\">New X-Men Ultimate Collection Vol. 3</a></li></ul>",
