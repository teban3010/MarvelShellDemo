    "deck": "An ancient mystical order of assassins founded in Japan. They are among Daredevil's greatest foes.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>The nascent Hand first formed about 800 years ago in feudal <a href=\"/japan/4020-55746/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55746\">Japan</a>, as a reaction to the oppressive class system that characterized Japanese society in that period. A number of Japanese citizens left their homes and settled in the mountains. There, they cultivated skill in ninjutsu, and through rigorous training became experts at assassination and espionage. The group officially came together in 1588 under the command of <a href=\"/kagenobu-yoshioka/4005-1798/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1798\">Kagenobu Yoshioka</a>, who turned his samurai school into a bastion of support for the common man. Yoshioka was eventually assassinated, and command of the group co-opted by the <a href=\"/snakeroot/4060-56349/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56349\">Snakeroot</a>, an ancient ninja clan who turned the Hand to demon worship and black magic. The Hand began working as mercenaries, and sought to extend its influence throughout the world.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Hand was created by <a href=\"/frank-miller/4040-7082/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-7082\">Frank Miller</a>.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><p>The Hand consists largely of unknown masked people, but has featured numerous named characters at various points in its history. Throughout its history various heroes have been press-ganged into service by the dark magic of the Hand. They have also employed numerous villains.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Chaste</h3><p>The Hand comes into constant conflict with a heroic group known as the <a href=\"/chaste/4060-55828/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55828\">Chaste</a>. This conflict is the first encounter with the Hand experienced by both <a href=\"/daredevil/4005-24694/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24694\">Daredevil</a> and <a href=\"/elektra/4005-1802/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1802\">Elektra</a>, with the latter first infiltrating and later joining the Hand for a time. The conflict eventually results in the defeat of the Hand, but also in the deaths of the Chaste's leader, <a href=\"/stick/4005-11018/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11018\">Stick</a>, and a member of the group named <a href=\"/shaft/4005-5182/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5182\">Shaft</a>.</p><h3>Enemy of the State</h3><p>The Hand, alongside scion organization <a href=\"/hydra/4060-3480/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3480\">HYDRA</a> and the mutant group Dawn of the White Light, orchestrates the abduction of <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a>. They brainwash him, and set him loose, intending to use him as the weapon he was designed to be to kill members of the superhero community. They send numerous operatives out across the world to deal with opponent superheroes, with limited success. They manage to kill and resurrect Elektra and <a href=\"/northstar/4005-3190/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3190\">Northstar</a>, both of whom are brainwashed to act as weapons for the Hand and HYDRA. Meanwhile, Wolverine escapes his brainwashing and turns on the Hand, commandeering a <a href=\"/sentinels/4060-4296/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-4296\">Sentinel</a> and invading their headquarters, destroying many of the Hand's members, as well as the organization's elite, with the assistance of Elektra, who had also managed to escape her conditioning.</p><h3>Shadowland</h3><p>Daredevil takes over command of the Hand after the Hand's repeated attempts to acquire a new warlord. He constructs a new headquarters for them in <a href=\"/hells-kitchen/4020-42295/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42295\">Hell's Kitchen</a>, called <a href=\"/shadowland/4020-57004/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57004\">Shadowland</a>, and dedicates himself into remodelling the group into a force for good. The group begins to corrupt him instead. After Daredevil kills <a href=\"/bullseye/4005-4647/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4647\">Bullseye</a>, he and members of the Hand crash the funeral and engage in a massive brawl which almost results in the death of the captive <a href=\"/ben-urich/4005-4799/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4799\">Ben Urich</a>. After a number of clashes between the Hand and the members of the superhero community, it is revealed that Daredevil is possessed by the demonic <a href=\"/the-beast/4005-61555/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61555\">Beast of the Hand</a>. He is defeated and apparently kills himself; in the ensuing confusion, control of the Hand is seized by <a href=\"/kingpin/4005-1483/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1483\">Kingpin</a> and <a href=\"/typhoid-mary/4005-1536/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1536\">Typhoid Mary</a>.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Film</h3><h4><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/elektra/4025-126/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-126\"><strong><i>Elektra</i></strong></a></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5830560-the%20hand%20film.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5830560\" data-ratio=\"0.62315789473684\" data-width=\"475\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 475px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5830560-the%20hand%20film.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5830560\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5830560-the%20hand%20film.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5830560-the%20hand%20film.jpg 475w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px\" data-width=\"475\"></a></figure><p>The Hand appears as the major antagonistic organization in this film.</p><h4><a href=\"/the-wolverine/4025-1359/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-1359\"><strong><em>The Wolverine</em></strong></a></h4><p>A similar organization known as the Black Ninja Clan appears in this film.

Using his vast telepathic powers and with help from his supercomputer <a href=\"../../cerebro/18-15073/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cerebro</a>, he located five mutants to help him in his prospects by forming the <a href=\"../../xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/34-41138/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Xavier Institute for Gifted Youngsters</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/36013/1578223-original_x_men.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1578223\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.744\" data-width=\"1000\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/36013/1578223-original_x_men.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1578223\"><img alt=\"Original X-Men vs Magneto\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/36013/1578223-original_x_men.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/36013/1578223-original_x_men.jpg 1000w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/3/36013/1578223-original_x_men.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/36013/1578223-original_x_men.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Original X-Men vs Magneto</figcaption></figure><ul><li><a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Scott \"Slim\" Summers</a> was the Professor's first student. Gifted and cursed with the ability to open dimensional portals with his eyes that produce a concussive force of destructive energy, he was forced to wear a visor made of ruby quartz to contain his blasts. Because of the look and shape of his visor, he took the code name Cyclops.</li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"/iceman/4005-1464/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1464\">Robert \"Bobby\" Drake</a>, a young man from Long Island, New York, was recruited after the sudden onset of his powers incapacitated one of his peers. He was jailed, for 'his own protection' against the angry and confused citizens of his town. Soon afterward, the wall of his cell was blown out and he was approached by Cyclops, who presented him with an offer to join the academy. He was given the name Iceman after his power to manipulate moisture and create ice.</li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"/beast/4005-1462/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1462\">Henry \"Hank\" McCoy</a>, born in Dunfee, Illinois to Norton and Edna McCoy was a genius with the brutish look. He excelled in athletics due to his physical nature but also studies profusely. When he began to attract animosity for his appearance and mutation, he was approached by Xavier to join his school. Hank took the name \"Beast\" as his mutation granted him larger hands and feet, much like a gorilla and super strength to match.</li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"/archangel/4005-2112/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2112\">Warren Kenneth Worthington III</a> was already a costumed crime fighter in his own right who went by the name \"the Avenging Angel.\" He was born to millionaire parents and was kept in a private school, forced to hide his physical mutation. He was recruited by Professor X and he retained the codename \"Angel\" due to his large feathery wings.</li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\">Jean Grey</a> was already a student (of sorts) of Professor X prior to the formation of the X-Men. After experiencing the death of her best friend, Annie, her telepathic powers were activated, forcing the young mutant to feel and sense her friend's passing. She was coached and helped by the Professor as he locks her powers away to keep her safe. As she develops telekinetic gifts she is invited to the school to become the sole female addition to the team. She takes the name \"Marvel Girl.\"</li></ul><p>The students are trained to use their gifts by Professor X who deems them the X-Men due to their extra abilities. The team becomes a tightly knit group, growing up from teenagers and learning to properly use their powers. Their first mission is against the evil mutant, <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto</a>, who is the self proclaimed \"Master of Magnetism.\" He attacked Cape Citadel and the X-Men prevented any damage or casualties.</p><p>During the initial run of X-Men they face Magneto's <a href=\"/brotherhood-of-evil-mutants/4060-17652/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-17652\">Brotherhood of Evil Mutants</a>, the teleporting <a href=\"/vanisher/4005-6756/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6756\">Vanisher</a>, the villainous Factor Three and the alien <a href=\"/lucifer/4005-14468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14468\">Lucifer</a>. Early in the series, Professor X is presumed dead and it is learned that he had been replaced, at his request, by the Changeling, a villain who wished to reform his criminal ways. The X-Men are also joined by the mutant Mimic, who has the ability to utilize up to five mutant abilities at a time. Mimic sought out the X-Men in an attempt to make his powers permanent, but was defeated and became an ally for a short time. The team was then joined by two new recruits; Havok, the plasma generating brother of Cyclops; and Polaris, the green haired, magnetism manipulating future confirmed daughter of Magneto. Eventually Beast left the team to pursue scientific endeavors.</p><p>Lineups:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Professor X</a>, <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops</a>, <a href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\">Marvel Girl</a>, <a href=\"/beast/4005-1462/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1462\">Beast</a>, <a href=\"/iceman/4005-1464/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1464\">Iceman</a> and <a href=\"/archangel/4005-2112/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2112\">Angel</a></li><li><a href=\"../../professor-x/29-1505/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Professor X</a>, <a href=\"../../cyclops/29-1459/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cyclops</a>, <a href=\"../../jean-grey/29-3552/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marvel Girl</a>, <a href=\"../../beast/29-1462/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beast</a>, <a href=\"../../iceman/29-1464/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iceman</a>, <a href=\"../../archangel/29-2112/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Angel</a>, <a href=\"/mimic/4005-12546/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12546\">Mimic</a> and <a href=\"/changeling/4005-12636/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12636\">Changeling</a></li><li><a href=\"../../professor-x/29-1505/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Professor X</a>, <a href=\"../../cyclops/29-1459/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cyclops</a>, <a href=\"../../jean-grey/29-3552/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marvel Girl</a>, <a href=\"../../beast/29-1462/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beast</a>, <a href=\"../../iceman/29-1464/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iceman</a>, <a href=\"../../archangel/29-2112/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Angel</a>, <a href=\"/polaris/4005-1473/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1473\">Polaris</a> and <a href=\"/havok/4005-3546/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3546\">Havok</a></li><li><a href=\"../../professor-x/29-1505/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Professor X</a>, <a href=\"../../cyclops/29-1459/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cyclops</a>, <a href=\"../../jean-grey/29-3552/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marvel Girl</a>, <a href=\"../../iceman/29-1464/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iceman</a>, <a href=\"../../archangel/29-2112/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Angel</a>, <a href=\"../../polaris/29-1473/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Polaris</a> and <a href=\"../../havok/29-3546/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Havok</a></li></ul><h2><b>Creation</b></h2><p>The X-Men were created by <a href=\"../../stan-lee/26-40467/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"../../jack-kirby/26-5614/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jack Kirby</a>, making their first appearance in <a href=\"../../x-men-x-men/37-6694/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men #1</a> in 1963. Stan Lee created the title 'X-Men' when publisher <a href=\"../../martin-goodman/26-43801/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Martin Goodman</a> turned down the original name ' The Merry Mutants' because he felt that people would not understand what a mutant actually was. Throughout the Marvel Universe, it is believed that the X-Men were named after Professor Xavier, their mentor but it is claimed that they were actually named after the X-Gene, the gene that created mutants.</p><p>One of the reasons for creating X-Men was the amount of mail Marvel was getting from the readers demanding a new superhero team because of all the solitary heroes in Marvel roster. Stan Lee wanted the heroes to have similar origin background, and because \"I could not get everyone bitten by radioactive spider\", Lee came up with the \"Homo Superior\" concept.</p><p>Some have pointed out that it is possible that the team was inspired by <a href=\"/dc-comics/4010-10/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-10\">DC Comics</a>' Doom Patrol. At the time <a href=\"/marvel/4010-31/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-31\">Marvel</a> was a new force on the comics scene and took a lot of its motivation and inspiration from DC (for instance the Fantastic Four were patterned after the <a href=\"/challengers-of-the-unknown/4060-16341/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-16341\">Challengers of the Unknown</a>). The similarities between numerous characters, and especially Professor X to <a href=\"/the-chief/4005-35126/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-35126\">the Chief</a> have led to this speculation.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><h3>The Early Years</h3><p>The Silver and early Bronze ages of comics published stories more in line with the standard at the time, meaning issues that consisted of self contained stories with little overall development of characters. One of the developments of Marvel is that the company became much more interested in character development, but this change was slow and the early years of the X-Men were marred with the same problems as other comics, if perhaps to a lesser degree.</p><h3>Late 70's</h3><h3>Deadly Genesis/Giant-sized X-Men</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4/13286-2763-14890-1-giant-size-x-men.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-13286\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5525\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:155.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4/13286-2763-14890-1-giant-size-x-men.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-13286\"><img alt=\"All New All Different\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4/13286-2763-14890-1-giant-size-x-men.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4/13286-2763-14890-1-giant-size-x-men.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px\" data-width=\"412\"></a><figcaption>All New All Different</figcaption></figure><p>The first big shake-up for the team came when the original team (plus Havok and Polaris, minus Beast) were abducted by the living island of Krakoa. First Professor X sent a brand new team of untried students trained by <a href=\"/moira-mactaggert/4005-8304/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8304\">Moira MacTaggert</a>. This team included Kid Vulcan, Darwin, Sway,and Petra, but they were quickly overtaken by the island. Petra and Sway were killed but Vulcan was left in suspended animation (partially due to Darwin's powers). When Krakoa released Cyclops to bring more mutants to feed on, Professor X gathered several young mutants who already had experience in their powers: Storm, Wolverine, Nightcrawler, Colossus, Thunderbird, Sunfire, and Banshee. Due to Professors X's mental manipulations, Vulcan's team was completely forgotten and Storm's team became known as the X-Men second generation. Following this mission, Marvel Girl, Iceman, Angel, Havok, and Lorna Dane (as well as Sunfire) all left the team allowing the remaining new members and Cyclops to become the new X-Men.</p><h3>New X-Men</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80248/1833613-387606_100958_jean_grey_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1833613\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80248/1833613-387606_100958_jean_grey_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1833613\"><img alt=\"Phoenix Rises\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80248/1833613-387606_100958_jean_grey_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80248/1833613-387606_100958_jean_grey_super.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Phoenix Rises\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80248/1833613-387606_100958_jean_grey_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80248/1833613-387606_100958_jean_grey_super.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Phoenix Rises</figcaption></figure><p>The newly formed team was comprised of diverse but strong personalities, making them very different from the original team. The new team consisted of adults rather than impressionable teenagers, and both Scott and Xavier found it challenging to get the team to work together. On their second mission, the team battled Count Nefaria, and despite earlier warnings, Thunderbird sacrificed himself for his teammates, and became the first X-Man to die in the line of duty. Subsequent missions had also put the new team against former X-Men members such as Havok and Lorna Dane (now going by the name of Polaris), who were under the influence of Shi’ar agent Eric the Red, and Kierrok and his N’gari. It was during these early periods that readers got their first glimpses of Moira MacTaggert, <a href=\"/black-tom-cassidy/4005-4568/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4568\">Black Tom Cassidy</a>, and <a href=\"/lilandra/4005-6144/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6144\">Lilandra</a>.</p><p>During a Christmas trip to New York City, the X-Men and Marvel Girl were attacked by <a href=\"/sentinels/4060-4296/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-4296\">Sentinels</a>, which led to the capture of Jean, Banshee and Wolverine. The remaining X-Men were dispatched to space to save the Starcore space station and their teammates. The team was attacked by Erik the Red, and robot duplicates of the original team along with Havok and Polaris. On the escape back to Earth, the spaceship was badly damaged and could not be piloted through use of auto pilot. After telepathically absorbing the information necessary to pilot the ship from Dr. Peter Corbeau, Marvel Girl volunteered to fly the ship back to Earth. She assumed that by creating a psionic shield of telekinetic energy she would be safe, and simultaneously forced Cyclops to sleep as she flew the ship back to Earth. Unfortunately, her body could not handle the strain and she perished. However, she is approached by a mysterious force that calls itself the Phoenix, and breathes new life into her. Her old burnt body is discarded as she was absorbed into the new body created by the force, perfectly identical to her old self in appearance. The ship landed in the Hudson Bay with all the X-Men safe, but they could not find Jean. While searching for Jean, she emerged from the river in a completely different costume and a fiery voice, and declared a new identity as the Phoenix. The team was uneasy but grateful that Jean had survived, but they quickly noticed that her powers were much more than they were before. She easily performs feats that she was never able to as Marvel Girl. At this point Xavier starts having visions of an alien being.</p><h3>Phoenix Saga</h3><p>Immediately after, the team (except Scott and Charles who were looking after Jean) battled the <a href=\"/juggernaut/4005-1445/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1445\">Juggernaut</a> and Black Tom Cassidy in Ireland, but before they were defeated, Jean as the Phoenix saved them. Cassidy was working for Erik the Red, a member of another race (<a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/shiar/4060-55854/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55854\">Shi'ar</a>) whom along with the help of Firelord, former herald of Galactus (deceived into helping him), seeks to destroy the X-men. Phoenix manages to fight off Firelord, but Xavier is approached by a human-like being from another faraway galaxy, looking for his help. She(<a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/lilandra/4005-6144/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6144\">Lilandra</a>), a Shi'ar, was led there by the telepathic connection she felt to Xavier from such a tremendous distance. She felt that only Xavier, with his abilities could help her and the universe from the impending disaster. However, Erik the Red (who is part of her race) manages to kidnap her and returns to his home planet via a teleporting device. Phoenix used her powers to revive this device, and the X-men find themselves confronted with the Alien race. Their emperor is in possession of the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/mkraan-crystal/4055-44426/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-44426\">M'kraan Crystal</a>, which Phoenix discovers to be able to destroy the entire universe by creating a black hole if activated. The X-men defeat the Shiar forces and Phoenix manages to deactivate the crystal using her new found psionic powers and bring the X-men back to earth. Much later, Jean is hypnotized by Mesmero and using her telepathic abilities to enhance his powers, Mesmero takes over the entire X-Men and make them work at a circus. They are however saved by Beast who returned from the <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a>. Wolverine manages to provoke Jean into becoming Phoenix, which brings back her memories and she frees everyone from Mesmero's control. At that point, Magneto appears and easily defeats Mesmero. He confronts the X-men in a caravan, and uses it to transport them to his base beneath a volcano in the antarctic. Their, the X-men fight magneto, but are defeated due to a lack of teamwork and coordination. Magneto ties them up to chairs that inhibit their basic bodily functions rendering them totally helpless. After he departs to Asteroid M to do research, Storm manages to free the team and the X-men ambush and defeat Magneto when he returns. However, the facility collapses, and Jean and Beast are separated from the rest, with each party thinking the other dead. Scott's group end up in the savage land while Jean and Hank manage to reach their mansion, where she informs the professor of the remaining X-men's demise. The X-men meanwhile protects the savage land from a resurrected god and manages to find their way back to their home which was abandoned. They track Jean to Muir island, where she is with Moira Mactaggart and there after a joyful reunion they face Proteus, Moira's deadly reality warping mutant son who kills people and takes over their bodies for survival. Proteus kills Moria's husband and takes over his body. With his memory and needs, Proteus goes after his 'wife' Moria, and manages to defeat most of the X-men in the process but is killed by Colossus.

She became much more aggressive in dealing with wrong doers. While saving the mutant <a href=\"/dazzler/4005-1498/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1498\">Dazzler</a> from a <a href=\"/hellfire-club/4060-13357/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13357\">Hellfire Club</a> task force, she completely dismantled a car with ease. During this time, the team had recruited a young mutant from Deerfield, Illinois named Katherine \"Kitty\" Pride. Kitty along with Storm, Colossus and Wolverine are captured by the Hellfire Club and held hostage but was eventually rescued through the efforts of an escaped Kitty and the remaining X-Men, mainly because of Phoenix defeating their leader Emma Frost single handedly.. The members of the Hellfire Club's inner circle were meanwhile plotting on brainwashing Jean into becoming a member. A former member of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, <a href=\"/mastermind/4005-8306/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8306\">Mastermind</a>, was primarily responsible for the psychic manipulation of Jean Grey. He initiated \"time slips\" to convince her that she was living in the past as his lover, himself being disguised as the extremely handsome Jason Wyngarde. Even though he was not a telepath, this was made possible using a mind-tap mechanism designed by Emma Frost, allowing him to plant false memories into Jean's mind. The X-men go to the hellfire club where Mastermind manages to put Jean under his control, this time under immediate orders from Sebastian Shaw, causing the 200 year time slip in her mind to think of herself as the Black queen. The X-Men attempted to intervene, but it only led to their capture with the exception of Wolverine, who makes a famous stand against the club's security and Inner Circle. Jean eventually overpowered Mastermind, and through the powers of the Phoenix, she put his mind in touch with the universe, which essentially overwhelmed his mind into catatonia. Her actions had caused her to become overwhelmed by her own powers, with each use of her limitless abilities causing her to get drawn nearer and nearer to her own dark persona, causing her mind to become highly unstable. Without warning, she transforms into the physical manifestation of her dark side as they were preparing to leave the area.</p><p>She and X-men engage in a fight, with her trying to destroy them and them, desperately trying to bring her old self back. She defeats them easily, and flies off into outer space, into another galaxy, where she consumes a star for sustenance, causing the deaths of all it's billions of inhabitants. She is detected by a Shi'ar space ship. Having seen what she did to the star system, Lilandra, the Shi'ar empress orders the ship to attack the Phoenix, but the ship is destroyed. Dark Phoenix then returned to Earth, to Jean's house where her family resides. There, she seemingly reverts to her old self and is happy to see her parents and sister, but when she senses the fear in them, she becomes Dark Phoenix again, threatening to kill them. She is stopped by the X-Men along with Beast and Beast confronts Jean in an attempt to calm and help her. With the aid of equipment created by Beast to disrupt Jean's power, they are able to temporarily overpower her but are defeated in the end, but Professor X, aided with the help of Jean from within the Phoenix, engages in a psychic battle with Dark phoenix and manages to defeat the Phoenix persona, putting psychic restraints into her to prevent another transformation. When all seems well, the X-Men are interrupted by Lilandra and the Shi'ar imperial guard. As empress, Lilandra is bound by Shi'ar laws to kill the Phoenix for the crimes she had committed against their empire, which was the \"eating\" of a star, and condemning a planetary system to death. The team is transported to the Blue Area of the Moon and Xavier reads Lilandra's mind and invokes Arin'n Haelar, a duel of honor that cannot be denied. The X-Men face off against the Imperial Guard of the Shi'ar. Once the X-Men are defeated, and upon seeing Scot getting cut down in front of her Jean loses control of her powers and personality, and the Dark Phoenix persona arises once again. Before Lilandra could order the destruction of the solar system to prevent Phoenix from becoming a threat again, Professor X instructed the X-Men to subdue Jean. But they only manage to weaken her, and only Scott is left with her in the end. Jean tells Scott through tears that she can no longer bear to live as someone who claimed so many lives, and used a Kree weapon to commit suicide, but not before telling him how much she loved him. Scott then realizes that it was her plan all along that if Lilandra's forces failed to kill her, she would take her own life.</p><h3>Days of Future Past</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80248/1833617-831402_dofp_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1833617\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.83606557377049\" data-width=\"305\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 305px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:83.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80248/1833617-831402_dofp_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1833617\"><img alt=\"Wolverine and Katherine on the run from Sentinels\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px\" data-width=\"305\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80248/1833617-831402_dofp_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80248/1833617-831402_dofp_super.jpg 305w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Wolverine and Katherine on the run from Sentinels\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80248/1833617-831402_dofp_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80248/1833617-831402_dofp_super.jpg 305w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px\" data-width=\"305\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Wolverine and Katherine on the run from Sentinels</figcaption></figure><p>With the death of Jean Grey, Cyclops left the team and Angel returned.

In that time line, the world is ruled by Sentinels, and mutants were sent to internment camps and killed. Most of the known X-Men at the time had perished with the exception of Colossus, Storm, Wolverine and Magneto. They were joined with the son of <a href=\"/invisible-woman/4005-2190/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2190\">Invisible Woman</a> and <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Mr Fantastic</a>, <a href=\"/franklin-richards/4005-2469/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2469\">Franklin Richards</a>, and the daughter of Cyclops and Jean Grey, <a href=\"/rachel-summers/4005-3566/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3566\">Rachel Summers</a>.

The X-Men, along with house guest <a href=\"/ms-marvel/4005-21561/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21561\">Carol Danvers</a>, traveled to space with the Starjammers and were kidnapped by Lilandra’s sister <a href=\"/deathbird/4005-6089/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6089\">Deathbird</a> and the terrifying <a href=\"/brood/4060-4987/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-4987\">Brood</a>. This lead to Danvers being transformed into the cosmically powered Binary and the X-Men almost being transformed into Brood creatures themselves. The X-Men returned to Earth to destroy the Brood embryo inside Professor X and discover that in their absence, the Professor has gathered a new group of young mutants, the New Mutants. Kitty was briefly demoted to the junior team until she proved herself against a Sidri Hunter on her own.</p><p> </p><h3>God Loves Man Kills</h3><p>The group calling themselves the Purifiers is laying waste to mutants across the country. They kill entire families, even children without remorse. Two children are killed and hanged in their school playground by a purifier strike team led by Anne, fanatically devoted to her cause. A heated debate is raging between Professor Xavier and Rev.William Stryker on TV, discussing the presence of mutants and their danger to humanity. As Xavier, accompanied by Cyclops and Storm return home from the Studio, they are ambushed and seemingly killed, with the attack made to look like an accident. Their attackers are revealed to be the Purifiers, headed secretly by Stryker himself. As the other X-men investigate the crash site, Wolverine finds out that the bodies recovered did not belong to the three X-Men. They sense an ambush and surprises the hidden purifier team with a direct attack. When things go out of hand, Magneto comes to their aid and they easily take care of the group. The operatives are taken prisoners and tortured by Magneto till they reveal the truth about Stryker and his ministry. Stryker's goal is the annihilation of mutantkind from the face of the Earth. Decades ago, when he realized his own child was a mutant, he killed his wife and child and tried to suicide, but was saved. He regarded this as God's message and considered himself as God's instrument to rid the world of mutants. For years he prepared, gathering resources and people to serve his cause, forming his ministry and thus his 'crusade' against the homo 'superior'.</p><p>Professor X is being subjected to chemical torture by Stryker, along with Dr Ramsey. His intention is to break the professor's mind and turn him into a puppet, and thus use his telepathic powers to attack every mutant in existence. After the torture, striker appeals to the Professor, who is no longer aware of his predicament to use his powers to kill Scott and Storm as a test run, which he seemingly carries out, unaware of what he is doing.</p><p>Meanwhile Kitty Pryde and Illyana spot a monitoring device outside facing the mansion. When they investigate, they are captured by the purifier Anne and taken to a secluded location for execution. However, Kitty escapes and manages to contact the X-men (despite being chased by Anne), who along with Magneto come to her rescue. However Illyana is still in Anne's custody and taken to their base. The X-men later kidnap Ramsey and from him learns what Stryker is planning to do with Xavier. Magneto attacks the Purifier's stronghold and rescues Illyana along with Storm and Scott (who are revealed to be barely alive, luckily just enough to fool Dr Ramsey's monitoring systems). Anne escapes this attack.</p><p>The Reverend commences the final phase of his plan by equipping the professor with a Cerebro-like device that amplifies his sensitivity, and orders him to seek out mutants and people with mutant genetic potential and eradicate them. On Madison Square Garden, he gives a public sermon as the attack is being carried out. The X-men who were preparing to assault Xavier's location is incapacitated. Magneto arrives and tries to stop his sermon but Stryker directs Xavier to focus on Magneto, who is terribly damaged. The crowd goes into chaos and the X-men, led by Cyclops seize this opportunity to attack Xavier. As the professor continues his attack, more and more mutants, including a senator present in the crowd experience pain and bleeding as due to cerebral hemorrhage. Ironically, Anne, who is beside Stryker experiences the same pain and Stryker, seeing she has mutant genes throws her off the podium (despite her intense resistance), killing her. The X-men penetrate deep into the building fighting of the pain and the Purifier forces and manage to stop Xavier, putting an end to the danger. They confront Stryker, who publicly justifies his act as the work of God and prepares to shoot Kitty when he is shot himself by a policeman.</p><p>Later, at the X-mansion, Magneto tries to persuade Xavier and the rest of his X-men to join his cause to create a world where mutants rule. The Professor, disillusioned by recent events almost agrees but is stopped by Scott, who gives him hope. As Magneto leaves, he warns that if the X-men fail in their ideals, it will be his turn.</p><h3>Mastermind's return and Madelyne Pryor</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80248/1833621-79291_114501_morlocks_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1833621\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:140.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80248/1833621-79291_114501_morlocks_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1833621\"><img alt=\"Callisto and the Morlocks\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80248/1833621-79291_114501_morlocks_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80248/1833621-79291_114501_morlocks_super.jpg 250w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Callisto and the Morlocks\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80248/1833621-79291_114501_morlocks_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80248/1833621-79291_114501_morlocks_super.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Callisto and the Morlocks</figcaption></figure><p>The X-Men discovered that Angel had been kidnapped by a community of underground dwelling mutants calling themselves <a href=\"/morlocks/4060-3191/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3191\">Morlocks</a> and led by a fierce woman named <a href=\"/callisto/4005-3423/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3423\">Callisto</a>.

She found herself resorting to violence more often and easily, and was even ready to kill on certain occasions. In accordance, she adopts a more punk look, cutting her incredibly long hair into a Mohawk and wearing leather and spikes. Combined with her Morlock vest, it is a vast change from her previous looks and temperament. However, on the day of the wedding, Mariko rejects Logan to the team's dismay. As she leaves, the readers are given a brief glimpse of Jason Wyngarde, thus confirming a master plan is in the works.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37015/808196-madelyne_pryor1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-808196\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.56125\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:156.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37015/808196-madelyne_pryor1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-808196\"><img alt=\"Scott and Madelyne get married!\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px\" data-width=\"409\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/37015/808196-madelyne_pryor1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37015/808196-madelyne_pryor1.jpg 800w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/37015/808196-madelyne_pryor1.jpg 614w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/37015/808196-madelyne_pryor1.jpg 409w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Scott and Madelyne get married!\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/37015/808196-madelyne_pryor1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37015/808196-madelyne_pryor1.jpg 800w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/37015/808196-madelyne_pryor1.jpg 614w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/37015/808196-madelyne_pryor1.jpg 409w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px\" data-width=\"409\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Scott and Madelyne get married!</figcaption></figure><p>Meanwhile, Scott, who was on leave, while boarding the plane to visit his family in Canada is shocked to see his pilot - a woman bearing a near perfect resemblance to Jean Grey.

Later, Scott proposes to Pryor and she accepts, but when he asks her if she really is the reincarnation of Jean, chaos begins as Phoenix seemingly takes her place and knocks him unconscious. It is revealed that Mastermind had recovered from catatonia imposed by Phoenix and seeks revenge against those who loved Jean. The 'Phoenix' later attacks the X-men and they are all led to believe that Jean Grey is back. Xavier, when he uses the Cerebro to learn the truth, is electrocuted. Scott, when he awakes from a dream, finally puts two and two together to arrive at the conclusion that things are not what they seem to be. He devices and executes a plan to lure Wyngarde to the open, which involves evading all the X-men (who are tricked into thinking he is Phoenix) and making Rogue acquire the unconscious Xavier's telepathic powers, which makes her see the truth from Scott's mind. She projects the truth to the X-men just in time when they are attacked by Wyngarde along with Pryor (who is deceived), but defeats him. Wolverine finds out that Mariko does indeed love him and it was all mastermind's ploy from the start. After paying one last visit to Jean's grave, Scott and Madelyne get married in a grant function.</p><h3>The Summers Family Expands</h3><p>Soon after on a mission with <a href=\"/alpha-flight/4060-14616/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-14616\">Alpha Flight</a> against <a href=\"/loki/4005-4324/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4324\">Loki</a>, they discovered that Madelyne was pregnant. This led more and more to her wishing Scott would leave the X-Men.</p><p>Shortly after this Rachel Summers, Cyclops’ daughter from Days of Future Past timeline arrived in the present. She became fast enemies with <a href=\"/selene/4005-2176/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2176\">Selene</a>, the new Black Queen of the Hellfire Club and was rescued by Xavier. She joined the X-Men without revealing to Cyclops who she really was. She eventually claimed the power and name of the Phoenix from her mother's holo-empathic crystal.</p><p>Unbeknownst to the rest of the X-Men, Professor X’s body wasn’t recovering from a severe beating he had received months earlier by mutant haters. He was slowly on the path to dying and refused to burden his students with it. At this point, he also invited Magneto to stay at the mansion with them as he had begun to repent for his past misdeeds. Also at this time, it was decided that Storm and Cyclops could no longer share the leadership responsibilities and there must be a decision made. They agree to a duel in the Danger Room of which the powerless Storm wins.</p><p>Lineups:</p><ul><li><a href=\"../../professor-x/29-1505/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Professor X</a>, <a href=\"../../cyclops/29-1459/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cyclops</a>, <a href=\"../../storm/29-1444/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Storm</a>, <a href=\"../../wolverine/29-1440/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wolverine</a>, <a href=\"../../colossus/29-1460/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Colossus</a>, <a href=\"../../nightcrawler/29-1461/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nightcrawler</a>, <a href=\"/beast/4005-1462/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1462\">Beast</a> and <a href=\"/archangel/4005-2112/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2112\">Angel</a></li><li><a href=\"../../professor-x/29-1505/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Professor X</a>, <a href=\"../../storm/29-1444/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Storm</a>, <a href=\"../../wolverine/29-1440/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wolverine</a>, <a href=\"../../colossus/29-1460/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Colossus</a>, <a href=\"../../nightcrawler/29-1461/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nightcrawler</a>, <a href=\"../../archangel/29-2112/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Angel</a> and <a href=\"/sprite/4005-20588/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20588\">Sprite</a></li><li><a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Professor X</a>, <a href=\"/storm/4005-1444/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1444\">Storm</a>, <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a>, <a href=\"/colossus/4005-1460/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1460\">Colossus</a>, <a href=\"/nightcrawler/4005-1461/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1461\">Nightcrawler</a> and <a href=\"/sprite/4005-20588/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20588\">Sprite</a></li><li><a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Professor X</a>, <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops</a>, <a href=\"/storm/4005-1444/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1444\">Storm</a>, <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a>, <a href=\"/colossus/4005-1460/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1460\">Colossus</a>, <a href=\"/nightcrawler/4005-1461/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1461\">Nightcrawler</a>, <a href=\"/kitty-pryde/4005-3548/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3548\">Shadowcat</a> and <a href=\"/rogue/4005-1446/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1446\">Rogue</a></li><li><a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Professor X</a>, <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops</a>, <a href=\"/storm/4005-1444/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1444\">Storm</a>, <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a>, <a href=\"/colossus/4005-1460/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1460\">Colossus</a>, <a href=\"/nightcrawler/4005-1461/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1461\">Nightcrawler</a>, <a href=\"/kitty-pryde/4005-3548/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3548\">Shadowcat</a>, <a href=\"/rogue/4005-1446/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1446\">Rogue</a>, <a href=\"/rachel-summers/4005-3566/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3566\">Rachel Summers</a> and <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto</a></li></ul><h2>Late 80’s</h2><p>At the trial of Magneto in France, <a href=\"/fenris/4060-56925/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56925\">Fenris</a>, the twin children of <a href=\"/baron-von-strucker/4005-4662/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4662\">Baron Von Strucker</a> attack Magneto as well as Xavier and <a href=\"/gabrielle-haller/4005-15049/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15049\">Gabrielle Haller</a>.

With Storm being the current leader, she is immediately informed of what is happening below. The team heads into the tunnels and Shadowcat and Nightcrawler are seriously injured. Shadowcat is now trapped in a permanent phased state and Nightcrawler is left in a coma. Colossus also loses control and snaps <a href=\"../../riptide/29-9732/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Riptide</a>'s neck.

He travels to New York and finds the team staying in the Morlock tunnels, and he learns about the Marauders and the massacre. He says that he wants to help and Havok rejoins the X-Men, while back in New Mexico, Polaris is attacked by the Marauders in the desert.

Havok is horrified to see Polaris leading the evil mutants, but still takes a killing shot at her to stop her from killing Madelyne. At this point the Marauders true leader is revealed to be <a href=\"/mr-sinister/4005-3179/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3179\">Mr Sinister</a> and he forced his team to move into the now mostly deserted Morlock tunnels.

While searching for Cable and preserving the Professor's life, Cyclops and Jean Grey are captured by the real attacker, a psionic mutant known as <a href=\"../../stryfe/29-7616/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stryfe</a>. The X-Men join with the new government sponsored version of X-Factor and members of X-Force to clear Cable's name and find the missing X-Men. It is revealed that Stryfe is a clone of Cable and therefore, in a way, a child of Scott and Jean. His rage comes from his supposed abandonment. In order to save the Professor, the team calls upon <a href=\"../../apocalypse/29-7612/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apocalypse</a> to counteract the virus making its way through his body. In the end, Stryfe is defeated and the Professor is saved.</p><h3>Fatal Attractions</h3><p>For more information regarding this arc, see: <a href=\"../../fatal-attractions/39-41878/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fatal Attractions</a></p><p>Even though the X-Men defeated Stryfe, saved the Professor and rescued Jean and Cyclops, Stryfe still managed a victory in form of a legacy. The <a href=\"../../legacy-virus/12-42281/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legacy Virus</a> was a disease that attacked only mutants and caused their powers to become powerfully out of control to a fatal end. The virus hit close to home with mutants suffering that had close ties to the X-Men like Pyro, <a href=\"../../revanche/29-9709/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Revanche</a> and Colossus' young sister Illyana Rasputin. Illyana, who had been reverted to childhood following the events of the Inferno, was still a latent mutant in her current form and was the first casualty of the virus. It hit Colossus hard as he had just lost both of his parents soon before. The X-Men held a vigil in her honor with all X-Teams in attendance to mourn her death. Wishing to pay his respects and offer asylum to any and all mutants interested, Magneto crashed the funeral in a show of misplaced aggression. He attacked the X-Teams and if not for the intervention of Colossus, would have lost. Colossus then states that he has lost faith in the dreams of other men, namely Xavier, and wishes to make his own path in a new world and joins Magneto in Asteroid M.</p><p>The X-Men waste little time putting together a strike force to infiltrate Asteroid M and discover the true intent of Magneto and the <a href=\"../../acolytes/65-9730/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Acolytes</a>. The Professor chooses a small team of <a href=\"../../quicksilver/29-1467/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Quicksilver</a>, Wolverine, Rogue, Gambit, Jean Grey and himself. The mission is successful until confronted by Magneto. In his rage, Magnus attacks the X-Men and makes short work of most of the team. In one of the most shocking moments in comic history, he aggressively fights Wolverine and rips out his adamantium skeleton. The Professor decides that enough is enough and his former friend cannot be saved and wipes his mind. Jean Grey then takes over leadership and forces the team back to the craft while keeping the Professor breathing and Wolverine alive. In the end, Wolverine is left in a feral state with very little active healing ability and unsure of his life and purpose.</p><p>With the Acolytes now in a power struggle, <a href=\"../../fabian-cortez/29-9728/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fabian Cortez</a> assumes leadership over Magneto's followers. He kidnaps Magneto's granddaughter and daughter to Quicksilver and the Avenger, <a href=\"../../crystal/29-2115/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crystal</a> and claims her in the name of Magneto. This enrages the Avengers and the X-Men who join forces to save <a href=\"/luna/4005-10962/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10962\">Luna</a> and take back Genosha. Cortez is defeated and <a href=\"../../exodus/29-4567/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Exodus</a> takes a leadership role with the Acolytes.</p><h3>Phalanx Covenant</h3><p>For more information regarding this arc, see: <a href=\"../../phalanx-covenant/39-42176/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Phalanx Covenant</a></p><p>After recently returning to the mansion, Banshee notices small oddities with the mansion and its inhabitants. He investigates and finds that the X-Men have been replaced by an unworldly batch of beings who are targeting mutants. With Jubilee, <a href=\"/sabretooth/4005-4563/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4563\">Sabretooth</a> and Emma Frost, he escapes to search for the next team of X-Men as noted by Cerebro. Meanwhile, Jean Grey and Cyclops have been on vacation away from the X-Men, saving themselves from imprisonment by the <a href=\"../../phalanx/29-9651/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Phalanx</a>. They join with Cable and Wolverine and search for the missing X-Men. Professor X, who had been offsite as well, gathered X-Force, X-Factor and Excalibur together in an old Acolyte base to form a plan. Knowing that the X-Men have been compromised, the other X-Teams split into three strike forces: one to infiltrate the Phalanx with \" <a href=\"../../warlock/29-7223/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Douglock</a>\", a resurrected Warlock with the memories of Doug Ramsey; one to confront a cluster of the Phalanx serving as the breeding grounds to a new generation of Earth born Phalanx; and one team to stay at the Acolyte base if all else fails. Forge is successful in creating a feedback which disables the birth of the new Phalanx. Douglock and his team stop the heralding beacon from summoning the rest of the Phalanx.</p><p>Cyclops team finds and rescues the captured X-Men almost simultaneously and discovers that Cameron Hodge plays a huge role in allowing the Phalanx entry and knowledge of our world. Banshee saves all but one of the new mutants and he and Emma Frost convert the Massachusetts Academy to a school to train the teenage team of Generation

During this time, several characters have alluded to the death of (present day) Cyclops and an incident he was responsible for that increased fear and hatred among humans against all of mutantkind.</p><h4>All-New X-Men</h4><p>The time-displaced original X-Men (sans Jean Grey) have dispersed across the country in an attempt to live normal lives. The past versions of Iceman, Beast, and Angel reunite to embark on a road trip and are joined by former Jean Grey School students Oya and Genesis, who have both had their fair share of hard times. When time-displaced Cyclops encounters a group of Cyclops fanatics named the <a href=\"/ghosts-of-cyclops/4060-62085/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-62085\">Ghosts of Cyclops</a>, he ends up battling them in a school library which causes both him and another young mutant named <a href=\"/thirst/4005-124599/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-124599\">Thirst</a> to be arrested. During their time in jail together, Thirst questions whether the young Cyclops is a disgruntled child of his group's idol. Scott reveals that he is indeed the real Cyclops and is in fact ashamed of his future self's actions.</p><p> </p><h4>Extraordinary X-Men</h4><p>Following the demise of the <a href=\"/jean-grey-school-for-higher-learning/4020-41138/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41138\">Jean Grey School For Higher Learning</a>, ex-headmistress Storm heads up efforts to combat the effects of the Terrigen Mist that is poisoning all mutants as well as the resulting public backlash due to the spread of M-Pox. To prevent the spread of disease, she has transported nearly all of her former students as well as both human and mutant refugees, to <a href=\"/x-haven/4020-61269/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-61269\">X-Haven</a>, a terraformed deposit of the demonic dimension <a href=\"/limbo-hell/4020-42990/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42990\">Limbo</a>, which Magik presides over. However, following an attack by <a href=\"/mr-sinister/4005-3179/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3179\">Mister Sinister</a> that takes down nearly half of the team (including their main defense from demonic invasion--Magik), the refugees of X-Haven are forced to step up to protect their new sanctuary.</p><p> </p><h4>Uncanny X-Men</h4><p>Consisting of Magneto, M (Monet St. Croix), Psylocke, an <a href=\"/avengers-xmen-axis/4050-84487/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-84487\">inverted</a> Sabretooth, and <a href=\"/the-dark-angel-saga/4045-56527/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56527\">a lifeless \"droid\"</a> Archangel, this group of extreme mutants have banded together to take preventative action against dangerous threats towards mutantkind.

Outraged, Cyclops sends out a psychic message to the world, revealing the truth of the Terrigen. He and his team then set out to destroy the Terrigen Clouds to prevent the extinction of the mutant race. Alchemy manages to destroy one of the two clouds before succumbing to the effects of the Mist and dying. Cyclops vows to destroy the second one, but is confronted by <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/black-bolt/4005-4329/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4329\">Black Bolt</a> and <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/medusa/4005-4327/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4327\">Medusa</a>, the Inhuman leaders. A fight ensues, and Black Bolt kills Cyclops when he sees him preparing to fire an optic blast. However, it is later revealed that Cyclops had died quite some time ago, and that Emma was simply using his image in order to give him a more meaningful death that could be used to rally the mutants against the Inhumans.</p><p>In the present, Beast discovers that there is no stopping the Terrigen Mist from spreading. The remaining cloud is becoming more saturated, and once it shrinks, will dissipate into the atmosphere, rendering the entire planet uninhabitable for mutants. Beast meets with representatives of the various X-teams and suggests that the X-Men prepare to leave the planet, but instead, Emma and Magneto propose a war to destroy the final cloud. The mutants launch an assault on <a href=\"/new-attilan/4020-59866/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-59866\">New Attilan</a>, leading to an all-out war between the X-Men and Inhumans. As this is going on, a team of young Inhumans led by <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/kamala-khan/4005-94118/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-94118\">Ms. Marvel</a> discover that the Terrigen Mist is killing mutants, and work with Forge and the young Cyclops to try and find a way to stop the conflict. <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/moon-girl/4005-124409/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-124409\">Moon Girl </a>and <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/iso/4005-107298/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-107298\">Iso</a> are able to explain the truth to Medusa, who voluntarily destroys the cloud herself. However, Emma is not sated by this, and unleashes an army of Sentinels that have been programmed to kill Inhumans. The X-Men and Inhumans unite to stop Emma, and upon her defeat, the conflict ends.</p><h4>ResurrXion</h4><p>In the aftermath of the conflict with the Inhumans, the X-Men set out to rebuild. The X-Mansion is relocated to Central Park in New York, with the X-Men wanting to show themselves to world and get back to their roots. Meanwhile, Magneto takes the time-displaced original X-Men under his wing, acting as their new mentor figure. The team operating out of the mansion are known as X-Men Gold, with X-Men Blue referring to Magneto's new team.

Later then the X-Men see their future selves and how they could end up. Showing Iceman as a huge monster, Beast is a beast and Jean is a Phoenix. Later the Scarlet Witch is auditioned to be a <a href=\"../../shield/65-3775/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SHIELD</a> agent and then turns them down.

The Team then gets a sudden change in members since Angel finds a civilization where he's accepted no matter how he looked while looking for his aunt. While Angel was enjoying being accepted the X-Men get an android as a 5th member of the X-Men, but it turned out that he ended up being consumed by lava because he wanted to look human but couldn't although Jean saved his brain.

Later while fighting Sentinels the team recruited Iceman. The Brotherhood of Mutants sent a spy to infiltrate the X-Men group to kill Professor X. They sent Wolverine. Magneto, The Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver, <a href=\"../../toad/29-1470/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Toad</a>, Multiple Man, the <a href=\"../../blob/29-3182/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blob</a> and Mastermind form the Brotherhood and they had kidnapped the President´s daughter. The X-Men saved her and in the last moment Wolverine had a change of heart and instead of killing Xavier he tried to kill Magneto, while he sent Sentinels to kill humans. In the end Xavier killed Magneto with the help of Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch.</p><p>Xavier then started helping Wolverine to find out where were the people who gave him the metal implants. <a href=\"../../weapon-x/65-50418/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Weapon X</a> did all the implants and they found it. Then the X-Men were abducted by Weapon X and were tortured and they even made Beast blue.</p><p>Ultimate <a href=\"../../alpha-flight/65-14616/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alpha Flight</a> arrived and seemingly kill Iceman and now the X-Men face these strange super powered team. Beast puts Iceman back together but Alpha Flight arrive to take Northstar, something that Colossus isn't very happy about. Alpha Flight was under the influence of a power enhancing drug called <a href=\"../../banshee/18-55849/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Banshee</a>. Taking <a href=\"../../northstar/29-3190/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Northstar</a> had Colossus so mad Dazzler, Nightcrawler, Rouge and him went after Alpha Flight. Cyclops went along to prevent anything stupid from happening. The <a href=\"../../acolytes/65-9730/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Acolytes</a> appeared into the picture and caused the death of Northstar. Colossus and the rest of the people who went along went under Banshee drug and enhanced their powers. Dazzler could maneuver her powers to create anything, Rouge could keep the power she absorbed, Nightcrawler could go to greater lengths, Colossus became stronger, and Cyclops could control his eye beams and fly.</p><p>Jean Grey had taken it into her own hands to lead the X-Men and she was driving them around pretty hard. Nightcrawler contacted her saying that they needed help from themselves because they were addicted to the power enhancer. Wolverine had figured out that he was positive to have been dosed with Banshee so he went to <a href=\"../../spider-man/29-1443/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Peter Parker</a> for help to sort things out. Kitty and Peter were dealing with Banshee addicts themselves when Wolverine arrived. Peter explained that he was positive because he was Banshee the drug was made by taking properties of him. The X-Men went after the addicted X-Men and fought it off. Jean went off for a moment while she talked to her father as Phoenix when then she fell unconscious. Logan blamed Colossus for it so he took his heart out for it.</p><p>Both X-Men embark on a flight until Phoenix stops it all. Everyone cools down for the exception of Cyclops that flies to the moon. During the fight Wolverine looses a leg to Colossus. Phoenix show to Colossus that Northstar is okay except that he is paralyzed from the waist down. Colossus and Wolverine are fixed up by Jean after that and then Jean heads to the moon. Wolverine using some of the Banshee Colossus bought he tracked it down to Muir Island blaming Xavier for it. Jean talked to Scott and after that he said he wanted to keep the power the Banshee started wearing off so she put his glasses back on. The Prof. was who created Banshee from Wolverine along with Magneto but Moira distributed it. She fought Wolverine with her \"Screaming\" powers. In the end Wolverine destroyed the whole facility. Quicksilver then arrived an told Moira that Magneto had newer plans for the near future.</p><p>20 Years into the future a new X-Men team that consisted of <a href=\"../../captain-america/29-1442/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Captain America</a>, Wolverine, Shadowcat, Rogue and a male Phoenix wanted to prevent the events of <a href=\"../../ultimatum/39-55745/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ultimatum</a> so they traveled back in time to stop it.</p><p>Reed and Sue were going to go on a date when the future X-Men arrived trying to kill Reed. Reed not having any internal organs couldn't be killed so they kidnapped him. The rest of the Fantastic Four went to the present X-Men for help. Reed discovered that the future male Phoenix was actually his son Franklin Richards. Then future Wolverine attempted to kill Phoenix. Then the rest of the future X-Men discovered that future Wolverine was actually a Sentinel from the future. By the time the FF and present X-Men got there many Wolverine Sentinels had been destroyed had killed Rouge and had taken Reed into the future. Captain America was dying and Jean unmasked him revealing he was actually Scott. He told the group that himself, Jean and the original Cap had been stripped away of their powers so he took over as Captain America after <a href=\"../../captain-america/29-1442/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Steve Rogers</a> aged 100 years, then he died. In the future Iceman was captured by the Sentinels and Reed escaped his cell when he followed a trail of fire. Thinking it to be <a href=\"../../human-torch/29-2120/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Johnny</a> he then saw the future Fantastic Four: Invisible Woman, Iron Thing, <a href=\"../../namor/29-1476/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Namor</a> and <a href=\"../../liz-allan/29-15408/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Firestar</a>.</p><p>The future X-Men, or what was left of them told the present X-Men and FF that the reason that they needed to stop it all was because the new ruler was getting rid of mutants. That new ruler was Sue. Future Sue convinced present Reed to fix a machine that would strip away people of their powers just like Cyclops´s Reed gave to her request while the present X-Men, present FF, and future X-men went into the future to find out what was going on. <a href=\"../../thing/29-2114/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ben</a> and Firestar found out that both of them in the future were in love and Iceman found himself being killed by Namor. Sue met <a href=\"../../mr-fantastic/29-2151/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nihil</a> again then just to find out that he was actually future Reed. Future Phoenix turned everyone in to his mother. Reed then took away future Sue´s powers since clearly she had gone crazy because of her brother´s death. Everyone let the future hero´s free from a prison in the <a href=\"../../the-negative-zone/34-40699/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Negative Zone</a> Sue had made to maintain the super powered heroes. The present FF and X-Men went back to their own time and Sue and Reed left to be alone. Sue told Reed she was worried that would eventually happen to them, but Reed assured that it would not. Sue left and then from a drawer Reed took out a ring, sure that, that future would not happen.</p><h4>Ultimatum and beyond</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5805942-ultimate%20x-men%20final.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5805942\" data-ratio=\"1.5188888888889\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.9%\" href=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5805942-ultimate%20x-men%20final.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5805942\"><img alt=\"New generation of X-Men\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/5805942-ultimate%20x-men%20final.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5805942-ultimate%20x-men%20final.jpg 900w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5805942-ultimate%20x-men%20final.jpg 632w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/5805942-ultimate%20x-men%20final.jpg 421w\"><noscript><img alt=\"New generation of X-Men\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/5805942-ultimate%20x-men%20final.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5805942-ultimate%20x-men%20final.jpg 900w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5805942-ultimate%20x-men%20final.jpg 632w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/5805942-ultimate%20x-men%20final.jpg 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"></noscript></a><figcaption>New generation of X-Men</figcaption></figure><p>In <a href=\"../../ultimate-x-men/49-7258/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ultimate X-Men</a> #100 we find that The Academy of Tomorrow has been attacked by Madrox on behalf of Magneto.

Professor Xavier believes sociopath is the next step in human evolution. The X-Men are framed for killing their own member Jean Grey by way of three cuts over the back and face. Leader of the police force known as \" <a href=\"../../brotherhood-of-evil-mutants/65-17652/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Brotherhood</a>\" named <a href=\"../../magneto/29-1441/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magnus</a> is put in charge of the investigation. As the search for the X-Men continues more and more of them are found dead. When a member of the city's police tracks down the X-Men's new leader Scott Summers and is informed that someone is setting them up. When he tells them to go to the police Scott responds. \"We're the X-Men, and no one is on our side\". Meanwhile a mysterious man in a bright red cape is investigating the crimes himself. After Warren Worthington is thrown from a roof top and Hank McCoy is shot and killed in a run in with The Brotherhood, Magnus orders the Brotherhood to take down <a href=\"../../sebastian-shaw/29-2175/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sebastian Shaw</a> (a powerful mob boss) and his Hellfire Club. Magnus believes with the X-Men out of his way and the Hellfire club killed off, the city will be \"his\". He meets with <a href=\"../../rogue/29-1446/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anne-Marie Rankin</a> to learn the whereabouts of the last few X-Men but she kills him instead. The caped figure later realizes that Jean Grey is not dead. What happened was that she killed Anne-Marie Rankin and took her place, because she wanted to avoid being studied by Xavier or exploited by Magnus. She then says she knows that the caped figure cannot kill her and pulls a gun on him but he then reveals that he is the twin brother of who she thinks he is and then pushes her off the roof causing them both to fall to their death. His twin, accompanied by Scott finds their bodies and says that he lost him years ago by what he had become. He recants about how when he and his brother both worked at a prison they started the whole cape thing because it made the inmates think he was in two places at the same time (making it seem like he has super powers). They meet up with <a href=\"../../wolverine/29-1440/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Logan</a> and sail off together.</p><h3><b>Egg's Men</b></h3><p>In the Showcase No. 65, It's revealed on Earth-Twelve the X-Men exist as the Egg's Men.

Originally, Grantray-Lawrence Animation wanted to make a Fantastic Four cartoon but Hannah Barabara got the rights to it, so they substituted them with the X-Men. The X-Men made their appearance in the Sub-Mariner episode \" <a href=\"../../doctor-doom/29-1468/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Doctor Doom's</a> Day\". Strangely enough, they were never actually referred to as the <i>X-Men</i>. They were, instead, referred to as the Allies for Peace, however the characters all went by their names from the comics and had their original designs from the comics as well. Magneto also made a guest appearance on Hannah Barabara's Fantastic Four Cartoon.

Apocalypse served as the game's final boss, transforming into a gigantic form. <em>X-Men vs. Street Fighter</em> was the first formal installment of the <em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em> series (as well as Capcom's broader <em>Capcom Vs.</em> series, which would include installments like <em>Capcom vs. SNK</em>, <em>Tatsunoko vs. Capcom</em> and <em>Street Fighter X Tekken</em>). It also introduced the popular tag feature to the series, with players selecting two characters who could swap out during battle.</p><p>The game proved successful enough to spawn another installment, <em>Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter</em>, in 1997. Only Wolverine and Omega Red returned as playable characters, while Apocalypse served as the sub-boss. This time, Cyber-Akuma, a version of Akuma who had been transformed into a Horseman of Apocalypse, appeared as the true final boss. <em>Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes</em>, followed in 1998, with Wolverine and Gambit being the only returning X-Men characters.

The game was released to tie into the first live-action movie, and actually featured the movie costumes as alternate outfits for the characters. Wolverine, Cyclops, Storm, Beast, Gambit and Phoenix appeared as the playable X-Men, while Mystique, Toad, Sabretooth and Magneto showed up as boss characters who could be unlocked. Apocalypse was also featured as a secret character, while Pyro appeared as an exclusive boss character in the Game Boy version. The game was followed by <em>X-Men: Mutant Academy 2</em> in 2001, which added Forge, Havok, Juggernaut, Nightcrawler, Professor X, Rogue, Psylocke and Spider-Man to the cast. When the next generation of game consoles rolled around, Activision released a third and final game in the series, <em>X-Men: Next Dimension</em>, for the PS2. Wolverine, Storm, Cyclops, Phoenix, Beast, Forge, Gambit, Psylocke, Magneto, Toad, Nightcrawler, Mystique, Rogue, Pyro, Bastion, Dark Phoenix, Betsy (an alternate version of Psylocke with different powers), Bishop, Lady Deathstrike and the Sentinel were all playable. The game had an original story which featured Bastion as the main antagonist.<em> X-Men: Next Dimension</em> was notable for being one of the first games to use the X-Men's then-recent leather outfits from <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/grant-morrison/4040-40434/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40434\">Grant Morrison </a>and <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-quitely/4040-7369/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-7369\">Frank Quitely</a>'s <em>New X-Men</em> run, rather than the <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jim-lee/4040-2399/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-2399\">Jim Lee</a>-designed outfits that had been used in all of the Capcom fighting games. It was also notable for bringing in <a href=\"/patrick-stewart/4040-68217/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-68217\">Patrick Stewart</a>, the actor who portrayed Professor X in the live-action films, to voice him in the game. The Activision games played similar to the Capcom games, with <em>Next Dimension</em> outright lifting moves from the <em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em> series.</p><p>Magneto, Storm and Wolverine also appear in Electronic Arts' 3-D fighting game <i>Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects</i>. Unlike the Capcom and <em>Mutant Academy</em> games, <em>Marvel Nemesis</em> was not very successful upon release. Electronic Arts began work on a new Marvel fighting game (with working titles ranging from <em>Marvel Chaos</em> to simply <em>Marvel</em>). Characters like Wolverine, Phoenix and Juggernaut were planned to appear, but the game was cancelled.</p><p>After Electronic Arts lost the rights to make Marvel games, Capcom was able to release <em>Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds</em>, in 2011. Wolverine, Storm, Magneto and the Sentinel returned, while Phoenix, Deadpool and X-23 made their debuts as playable characters.</p><h4>Film-based games</h4><p>To coincide with the release of the third film, Activision has released <i>X-Men: The Official Game</i> which filled in gaps between <i>X2: X-Men United</i> and <i>X-Men: The Last Stand</i>, such as explaining Nightcrawler's absence from the third film.</p><h4>Marvel: Ultimate Alliance</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5805945-x0men%20lenges%202.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5805945\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5805945-x0men%20lenges%202.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5805945\"><img alt=\"X-Men Legends II\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5805945-x0men%20lenges%202.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5805945-x0men%20lenges%202.jpg 1024w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/5805945-x0men%20lenges%202.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5805945-x0men%20lenges%202.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"X-Men Legends II\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5805945-x0men%20lenges%202.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5805945-x0men%20lenges%202.jpg 1024w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/5805945-x0men%20lenges%202.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5805945-x0men%20lenges%202.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>X-Men Legends II</figcaption></figure><p>Two role-playing video games entitled <i>X-Men Legends</i> (2004) and <i>X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse </i>(2005) were also released to great success.

Meanwhile, Sebastian Shaw, the Black King of the Hellfire Club and an embittered, now cast-aside pawn in Magneto's mad scheme, is forming a terrible plan of revenge.</i></p></blockquote><blockquote data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"center\"><ul><li>Written By: Steve Lyons</li><li>Publisher: Ibooks (October, 2002)</li><li>ISBN-10: 0743452666</li><li>ISBN-13: 978-0743452663</li></ul></blockquote></td></tr></tbody></table><h4>X-Men: The Legacy Quest Trilogy Omnibus</h4><table><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67663/2134001-x_men_the_legacy_quest_trilogy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2134001\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.6195652173913\" data-width=\"184\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 184px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:162.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67663/2134001-x_men_the_legacy_quest_trilogy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2134001\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 184px) 100vw, 184px\" data-width=\"184\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67663/2134001-x_men_the_legacy_quest_trilogy.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67663/2134001-x_men_the_legacy_quest_trilogy.jpg 184w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67663/2134001-x_men_the_legacy_quest_trilogy.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67663/2134001-x_men_the_legacy_quest_trilogy.jpg 184w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 184px) 100vw, 184px\" data-width=\"184\"></noscript></a></figure></td><td><blockquote><p><i>The stunning X-Men trilogy in one giant volume.</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Hank McCoy -the X-Men's Beast- has been working to find a cure for the deadly Legacy Virus that has been sweeping through the world's mutant population.

The first X-Men figures were of Wolverine and Magneto, which were included in Mattel's Secret Wars line. The X-Men got their big break when the Marvel license transferred to ToyBiz, who began producing figures based on the comics. This soon expanded to include the 90s animated series, and the resulting toys proved extremely popular. As time went on, ToyBiz also produced figures for the live-action <em>X-Men</em> movies and the X-Men Evolution cartoon. The X-Men began appearing in ToyBiz's 6-inch Marvel Legends line, and eventually proved popular enough that they fronted their own spin-off line called X-Men Classics.</p><p>The license later transferred to Hasbro, who produced some figures for <em>X-Men: The Last Stand</em> and <em>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</em>, but largely stopped making movie figures based on the franchise after that. The X-Men have continued to appear in Hasbro's Marvel Legends and Marvel Universe lines, and were also featured in the child-oriented Super Hero Squad and Marvel Mashers lines.</p><p>Additionally, throughout the years, many different companies have produced X-Men clothing and apparel. Halloween costumes featuring X-Men characters were also common, especially during the height of the franchise's mainstream prominence during the time the original movies were coming out. Even with the franchise's popularity having peaked some time ago, Wolverine remains a popular Halloween costume choice for children.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6842979-xmenclassics.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6842979\" data-ratio=\"0.79979674796748\" data-width=\"984\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 984px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6842979-xmenclassics.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6842979\"><img alt=\"X-Men Classics by ToyBiz\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6842979-xmenclassics.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6842979-xmenclassics.jpg 984w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/6842979-xmenclassics.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6842979-xmenclassics.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"X-Men Classics by ToyBiz\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6842979-xmenclassics.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6842979-xmenclassics.jpg 984w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/6842979-xmenclassics.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6842979-xmenclassics.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>X-Men Classics by ToyBiz</figcaption></figure><p>Funko has also produced a selection of X-Men bobbleheads (with the characters also appearing in the company's spin-off lines like Dorbz), while Diamond has featured the X-Men in their Marvel Select and Minimates lines.The X-Men have also been featured in the HeroClix figure game multiple times, and have even been the subject of their own waves.

One of the first distinctions among the Morlocks, was with one group, the Tunnelers, who had grown dissatisfied with Callisto's main group of Morlocks, so splintered off.

    "description": "<p>There have been several groups of mutant youths that have utilized the name the Hellions.

Initially, being that Xavier Institute was a school, it was simply a means to train young mutants in the use and responsibility of their powers. It evolved into becoming training grounds to become field trained and X-Men ready. The design was simple, in the event that the X-Men were not able to perform the New Mutants would fill the spot, which they eventually did.</p><p>Unbeknown to Xavier, an organization caught wind of his activities and followed quickly after. This group was better known as the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-13357\" href=\"/hellfire-club/4060-13357/\">Hellfire Club</a>. The Hellfire Club is a sinister international group of the world's social elite. They are run by mutants that consider themselves superior to other mutants, in both their mutant abilities/powers and social status. They copied Xavier's design perfectly. They even had their own telepath, quite powerful at that, to front and run the school, by the name of Emma Frost then known as the White Queen.</p><h2>The Massachusetts Academy</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/74068/2685332-2685331-massachusettsacedemy.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2685332\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75917767988253\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/74068/2685332-2685331-massachusettsacedemy.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2685332\"><img alt=\"The Massachusetts Academy\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/7/74068/2685332-2685331-massachusettsacedemy.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/74068/2685332-2685331-massachusettsacedemy.jpeg 681w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/74068/2685332-2685331-massachusettsacedemy.jpeg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/7/74068/2685332-2685331-massachusettsacedemy.jpeg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>The Massachusetts Academy</figcaption></figure><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-1457\" href=\"/emma-frost/4005-1457/\">Emma Frost</a>, the White Queen of the Hellfire Club's Inner Circle, funded and purchased a private school in the Snow Valley, located in the Berkshire Mountains in Massachusetts. She named the private school, the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-47788\" href=\"/massachusetts-academy/4020-47788/\">Massachusetts Academy</a>. She was the headmistress of the school, and it was here that she would train her future Hellions. Her intentions for the Hellions were, when fully trained, they would serve the interest of the Hellfire Club's <a data-ref-id=\"4005-34656\" href=\"/the-inner-circle/4005-34656/\">The Inner Circle</a>.</p><p>The Inner Circle seeks to amass absolute power and control, over all things political and economical, through both legal and illegal activities, any means necessary. The Hellions were to be the \"any means necessary.\" As such, Emma needed to seek out and recruit very specific mutants, with abilities that would further aid her organization and later herself.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The success of the New Mutants grew and in the 1984 <a data-ref-id=\"4040-40468\" href=\"/chris-claremont/4040-40468/\">Claremont</a> created an antagonizing team named the Hellions to be the New Mutants nemeses. The Hellions were very similar to the New Mutants and the two teams would go-head-to-head throughout the New Mutants run.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><p>Similar to Professor Xavier, Emma Frost brought together six mutants and made it her duty to shape them into mutants much like herself and the Inner Circle. Her main focus was that she couldn't let anyone get to the mutants before her, especially Xavier. It was then that Emma had a computer, very similar to the original <a data-ref-id=\"4055-15073\" href=\"/cerebro/4055-15073/\">Cerebro</a>, created to amplify her mental talents. Once done, her search would begin. Once she located her potential students, she mentally hid their presence from all others until she could recruit them herself.</p><h3>Warpath (James Proudstar)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12463/302341-40284-hellions.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-302341\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.1111111111111\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:111.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12463/302341-40284-hellions.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-302341\"><img alt=\"Warpath\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12463/302341-40284-hellions.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12463/302341-40284-hellions.jpg 90w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 90px) 100vw, 90px\" data-width=\"90\"></a><figcaption>Warpath</figcaption></figure><p>Thunderbird (now known as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2158\" href=\"/warpath/4005-2158/\">Warpath</a>): James was the younger brother of the X-Men <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2174\" href=\"/thunderbird/4005-2174/\">Thunderbird</a>.

Catseye could morph into a lavender panther-like wildcat OR a transitional hybrid form granting her the best qualities of both a human and cat. Fiercely loyal she protected her friends to no end. But in reality she hardly understood the normal world prefer the life of a cat.</p><h3>Empath (Emmanuel Alfonso Rodrigo De la Rocha)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12463/302334-185655-hellions.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-302334\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.1111111111111\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:111.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12463/302334-185655-hellions.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-302334\"><img alt=\"Empath\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 90px) 100vw, 90px\" data-width=\"90\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12463/302334-185655-hellions.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12463/302334-185655-hellions.jpg 90w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Empath\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12463/302334-185655-hellions.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12463/302334-185655-hellions.jpg 90w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 90px) 100vw, 90px\" data-width=\"90\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Empath</figcaption></figure><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-2173\" href=\"/empath/4005-2173/\">Empath</a> was more like the White Queen then any other on the team. He was ruthless, cunning and willing to use his powers on anyone for personal gain. Empath's power (just like his name) was the ability to read, feel and control the emotions of others. He is able to perform this feat on individuals singly or on the city-wide level. Empath was one of Frost's favorites due to their similarities, also one of her biggest pains for the same reason. Empath would be the only member of the Hellions, actually present during their final battle with Fitzroy, to survive and leave the night unscathed. Due, largely in part, to his quick retreat once the Sentinel began their invade.</p><h3>Jetstream (Haroum ibn Sallah al-Rashid)</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12463/302337-162122-hellions.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-302337\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.1111111111111\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:111.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12463/302337-162122-hellions.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-302337\"><img alt=\"Jetstream\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 90px) 100vw, 90px\" data-width=\"90\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12463/302337-162122-hellions.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12463/302337-162122-hellions.jpg 90w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Jetstream\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12463/302337-162122-hellions.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12463/302337-162122-hellions.jpg 90w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 90px) 100vw, 90px\" data-width=\"90\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Jetstream</figcaption></figure><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-2143\" href=\"/jetstream/4005-2143/\">Jetstream</a> shared powers and responsibilities similar to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1496\" href=\"/cannonball/4005-1496/\">Cannonball</a>, who could also propel himself through the air and was also team leader. Though, he didn't share his protective force field Cannonball generated during flight. Jetstream's body didn't have built in protections from the effects of his powers. When Jetstream would lift off the friction and force of the wind that he would fly through would flay his flesh and also cause severe burns or even catch him on fire. The Hellfire Club would remedy this and provide Jetstream with a bionic system that enabled more control, focus and protection from his powers. As a result, he pledged undying lifelong loyalty to them.</p><h3>Roulette (Jennifer Stavros)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12463/302338-40875-hellions.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-302338\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.1111111111111\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:111.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12463/302338-40875-hellions.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-302338\"><img alt=\"Roulette\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 90px) 100vw, 90px\" data-width=\"90\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12463/302338-40875-hellions.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12463/302338-40875-hellions.jpg 90w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Roulette\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12463/302338-40875-hellions.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12463/302338-40875-hellions.jpg 90w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 90px) 100vw, 90px\" data-width=\"90\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Roulette</figcaption></figure><p>Born to a casino Poker card dealer in Atlantic City.

Tarot is a precog, with the ability to materialize and animate (purely of psionic energy) tangible, solid representation of the images on her tarot cards. Once created, she had full control of them and they would do battle for her or be used as a transportation device for the team. Her future was to be surrounded in mystery, and more lasting then many of the other Hellion teammates.</p><p>With the final member's acceptance of the White Queen's invitation to the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-47788\" href=\"/massachusetts-academy/4020-47788/\">Massachusetts Academy</a>, Emma's search would be over. These young mutants would represent the initial core group, The Hellions.</p><h2>Members come and Go.</h2><p>Others would join to replace members that would leave, or some would be added as ploys. These individuals included:</p><ul><li>The Fiery, on again, off again New Mutant <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4558\" href=\"/magma/4005-4558/\">Magma</a> (Amara Juliana Olivians Aquilla).</li><li>The Bio-electrically charged <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2141\" href=\"/bevatron/4005-2141/\">Bevatron</a> (Fabian Marechal-Julbin) would fill the slot Firestar would leave open.</li><li>The super strong, not so smart <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2139\" href=\"/beef/4005-2139/\">Beef</a> (Buford Wilson) would fill Thunderbird's eventual slot.</li><li>One other individual was offered a spot on the team but declined (revealed a lot later in the Marvel Continuity). Older brother of future X-Force member <a data-ref-id=\"4005-15329\" href=\"/jesse-bedlam/4005-15329/\">Jesse Bedlam</a>/Aaronson, Christopher Terrance Bedlam/Aaronson, later known as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-15576\" href=\"/king-bedlam/4005-15576/\">King Bedlam</a>. King Bedlam was gifted with the mutant talent to create telepathic static which could control bodily or mental functions, this gave him immunity to mental tampering. When he declined, tried as she might, not even Emma's telepathic persuasion could change his mind. And she tried HARD. Emma didn't take kindly to the word \"No.\" His short time with the team, while making his decision, led to a strong emotional tie with Tarot. They fell in love quickly and, in a still unclear way, the two lovers' souls somehow inextricably became bound together. This would lead to Tarot's later resurrection.</li><li>Finally there was the microwave manipulating, future Avenger <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2101\" href=\"/firestar/4005-2101/\">Firestar</a> (Angelica Jones). Emma never had intentions for Firestar to join or be apart of the main group. Emma along with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-8300\" href=\"/trevor-fitzroy/4005-8300/\">Trevor Fitzroy</a>, a time traveling mutant from the future, trained her separately and hidden from the others. Firestar was to be the White Queen's personal assassin due to Firestar's destructive and devastating nature of her mutant abilities. Her first mission was to, but never happened, kill the Black Queen of the Hellfire Club (at that time it was <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2176\" href=\"/selene/4005-2176/\">Selene</a>) who Emma felt threatened by. This was all for naught as the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-11896\" href=\"/new-warriors/4060-11896/\">New Warriors</a> interfered and won the freedom of Firestar, and she joined them instead.</li></ul><h2>The Hellions End.</h2><p>This group of Hellions were together for years, and built a bond that only time could create. They would do battle with many of Marvel's heroes. Though they were created to battle and be enemies with the New Mutants. Through time it simply turned into something similar to a high school rivalry. The Hellions became more then a team, they were a family that most of them were deprived in their normal lives. Unfortunately, all this would be destroyed in one night.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66472/1256866-hellions_with_emma_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1256866\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.55200655200655\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66472/1256866-hellions_with_emma_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1256866\"><img alt=\"Emma Frost and The Hellions\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66472/1256866-hellions_with_emma_1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66472/1256866-hellions_with_emma_1.jpg 1221w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/66472/1256866-hellions_with_emma_1.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66472/1256866-hellions_with_emma_1.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Emma Frost and The Hellions\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66472/1256866-hellions_with_emma_1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66472/1256866-hellions_with_emma_1.jpg 1221w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/66472/1256866-hellions_with_emma_1.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66472/1256866-hellions_with_emma_1.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Emma Frost and The Hellions</figcaption></figure><p>As a means to lower tension between the X-Men and the Hellfire Club, Emma threw a party and invited the X-Men (the Gold team led by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1444\" href=\"/storm/4005-1444/\">Storm</a>). Many of the Hellfire Club's Inner Circle were being murdered and Emma felt that if they were targets that the X-Men wouldn't be too far from being the next targets. She wanted the teams to create an alliance, as she felt there was strength in numbers. Animosity between the two teams raged. Old rivalries, coupled with the immaturity of the Hellions egging the X-Men on led to a small skirmish that was quickly brought a halt when two (though at the time they could only see one, the other was using a cloaking device) unknown assailants broke in an attempted to assassinate the Emma. The female assassin immediately lunged at Emma. Emma far too quick, used a telepathic blast to take down her would-be attacker. While the teams regrouped and tried to question the girl/assassin, another attack began, though they had no clue from where. Even <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\" href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\">Jean Grey's</a> and Emma's vaunted telepathic gifts didn't register the second person.

The female attacker was sent in as a ploy to get the teams attention. Within the initial 20 seconds of his appearance he had already killed both Jetstream and Beef.

Empath tries to use his powers to see if she was alive, and runs when he finds that she was dead, or so he thought. The Sentinels decimate most of the Hellions and the X-Men barely get out with their lives. The remaining living Hellions, that didn't die in the fight, would have their life forces drained by Fitzroy, ultimately killing them, so he can open a temporal gate for his teammates to come through.</p><p>Those who were killed in the melee were: Jetstream, Beef, Bevatron, Roulette, Catseye and Tarot. As a side note, at the party there were approximately fifteen other Hellions that are shown but never given a name. It's assumed that Emma had recruited others but were not a part of the main team. They may not have had powers suited for battle, though this is never touched on. What is clear is that all the un-named Hellions would, too, have the life forces drained by Fitzroy. Though it seemed as if Emma was given a mortal blow, she actually did not die, but was put into a coma.</p><p>When she awakens from her coma, she is informed of the death of her students. Grief-stricken and feeling completely responsible for their deaths, something changed in her. Unknown by all, Emma, over the years, grew to love and care for her students, her team of Hellions. The guilt over her loss would lead to her eventual reform. Tarot's story, too, was not over yet either. She is shown later in the page of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-15595\" href=\"/x-force/4060-15595/\">X-Force</a> alive. Tarot would be resurrected, due to her bond with King Bedlam. To be explained in New Hellions section. Other survivors (either because they were not apart of the team or left before the final battle) included: Thunderbird, Empath, Magma and Firestar (although not officially a member).</p><p>Additionally, it was noted in one of the Marvel Handbooks that a come of the New Mutants were members of the Hellions as well. A team of New Mutants were killed then resurrected by the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10300\" href=\"/beyonder/4005-10300/\">Beyonder</a>. When they were brought to like they were mere husks of their former selves. They showed no emotion, being that their deaths affected their psyches greatly. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\" href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\">Magneto</a> was, at that time, the headmaster at Xavier Institute and also the White King of the Hellfire Club. He made the decision to send the affect students to Emma so that she could provide telepathic therapy to the students. While there, they were enrolled into the Massachusetts Academy and inducted as members of the Hellions, even participating in team training activities. This led to friendship being built between the team. They were: Cannonball, Douglas \"Doug\" Ramsey (<a data-ref-id=\"4005-14559\" href=\"/cypher/4005-14559/\">Cypher</a>), <a data-ref-id=\"4005-8303\" href=\"/illyana-rasputin/4005-8303/\">Illyana Rasputin</a> (then Magik), Rahne Sinclair (<a data-ref-id=\"4005-4557\" href=\"/wolfsbane/4005-4557/\">Wolfsbane</a>), X'ian Coy Mahn (<a data-ref-id=\"4005-9849\" href=\"/karma/4005-9849/\">Karma</a>) and Amara Juliana Olivians Aquilla (<a data-ref-id=\"4005-4558\" href=\"/magma/4005-4558/\">Magma</a>).</p><p>Once cured of their ailments they quickly returned to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41138\" href=\"/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/4020-41138/\">Xavier Institute</a> as it would be revealed that Magneto's decision to transfer his students was actually due to mental tampering from Empath. All would return save Magma who chose (or so she thought, later revealed to be manipulated by Empath's powers) to stay behind and remained with the Hellions.</p><h2>Original Team Stats</h2><p><b>Former Members:</b></p><p>Empath, Roulette, Thunderbird ll, Catseye, Tarot, Jetstream, Bevatron, Beef, Magma, Cannonball, Karma, Cypher, Wolfsbane &amp; Firestar (unofficial)</p><p><b>Base of Operations:</b></p><p>Massachusetts Academy</p><p><b>First Appearance:</b></p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4050-3234\" href=\"/the-new-mutants/4050-3234/\">New Mutants</a> (vol.1) #16</p><h2>The \"Unofficial\" Hellions.</h2><p>The second group of \"Hellions\" was never truly an official incarnation of the Hellions.

The very first mission for <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\" href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\">Magneto</a> and his X-Men is to capture the Hellions and bring them to the authorities to have them pay for the crimes they have committed.

As anyone might surmise from those four words, Simon Utrecht craved POWER and it wasn't enough that he had already acquired millions of dollars, being a serious industrial competitor of <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Tony Stark</a> and having held political office, he wanted more! He wanted the might of the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a> and was willing to put his fortune on the line as well as his life and the lives of his three companions to obtain that power, sailing them right into the heart of a Cosmic Storm.</p><p>Tapping the knowledge of , Life-Support Specialist, <a href=\"/vapor/4005-6790/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6790\">Ann Darnell</a> and her brother, Fuel Propulsion Engineer, <a href=\"/x-ray/4005-6822/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6822\">Jimmy Darnell</a>, Utrecht goads Mike Steel into flying the ship. The Dynamic is now complete with four members ready to set sail to limitless power.</p><p>The sound of the rocket's propulsion wakens <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Bruce Banner</a> from his crater bed in the near by desert area, where he had been left by the <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a> after reentering earths atmosphere. Deducing that the rocket configuration and trajectory could only mean space flight, Banner rushed to the mission control room to discover that the ship is headed straight for a cosmic storm, instruments reading radiation levels off the chart. Fearing for their safety Banner reprograms the flight control computer to bring them back before they are killed by radiation poisoning.</p><p>The occupants are bathed in the cosmic radiation, each of them experiencing something unique. Mike expresses that it feels as thought the weight of the ship were on his shoulders, his body somehow bonding with the ships alloy. Jimmy states that he feels aglow with power. Ann melds with the life support systems and Simon is overwhelmed by a mass of data somehow connected to the ships computers, as if he were vectoring towards the stars themselves. The rocket returns crashing to earth with such a crushing explosion that Banner fears nothing could have survived the impact.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26196/555951-hulk254_09b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-555951\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.544\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26196/555951-hulk254_09b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-555951\"><img alt=\"U-Foes Emerge\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/26196/555951-hulk254_09b.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26196/555951-hulk254_09b.jpg 1000w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/2/26196/555951-hulk254_09b.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/26196/555951-hulk254_09b.jpg 621w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px\" data-width=\"621\"></a><figcaption>U-Foes Emerge</figcaption></figure><p>Much to Banner's surprise, four beings emerge from the wreckage with incredible powers.</p><p><b><a href=\"/vector/4005-6820/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6820\">Vector</a>:</b> (Simon Utrecht) has the ability to vector/repel any object no matter it's weight size or density.</p><p><b><a href=\"/vapor/4005-6790/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6790\">Vapor</a>:</b> (Ann Darnell) Exhibits the ability to change her form into any gaseous mixture she imagines.</p><p><b><a href=\"/x-ray/4005-6822/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6822\">X-Ray</a>:</b> (Jimmy Darnell) Commands radiation of all classifications and can project them offensively.</p><p><b><a href=\"/ironclad/4005-6821/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6821\">Ironclad</a>:</b> (Mike Steel) Emerges with a metallic hide, the ability to control his density and Hulk class strength.</p><p>Immediately the quartet blame Banner for robbing them of even greater power by having brought them back too early. Banner is shocked by the revelation that they would expose themselves to dangerous levels of radiation intentionally, to which Simon Utrecht replies, \"You make it sound as if it were madness to seek after power! Perhaps it is when the quest ends in failure. But we have attained the power which we sought!\"</p><p>While pummeling Banner and continuing the blame game, Ironclad uses his cosmic irradiated logic to title the quartet the U-Foes.

Each member demonstrates a level of selfishness while trying to work as a team, catching Ironclad in friendly fire. While having the ability to defeat the giant green brute, ultimately the U-Foes end up defeating themselves as their increasing powers get the better of them, becoming uncontrollable. <a href=\"/vapor/4005-6790/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6790\">Vapor</a> unable to maintain her atomic structure dissipates into the air. <a href=\"/vector/4005-6820/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6820\">Vector</a> suffocates himself as he unwillingly pushes away even the smallest air molecule and pushes himself away from the earth into the outer atmosphere. <a href=\"/x-ray/4005-6822/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6822\">X-Ray</a> is unable to control the radiation combination, explodes in the sky and <a href=\"/ironclad/4005-6821/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6821\">Ironclad</a>'s mass density get so heavy that he sinks into the ground working his way towards the earth's core.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The U-Foes were created by <a href=\"../../bill-mantlo/26-42478/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bill Mantlo</a> and <a href=\"../../sal-buscema/26-12717/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sal Buscema</a> in 1980 and first appeared in <a href=\"../../the-incredible-hulk/49-2406/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Incredible Hulk</a> # 254.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><p>Of course this was not the end of the U-Foes. The team has tried to get revenge on the Hulk a multitude of times after their initial incarnation. They pop up every now and again with a second string treatment level but with first rate potential.</p><p>Much like the Fantastic Four, the team uses a family structure sharing the same goals and working together to reach their targets. Simon shares a romantic relationship with Ann much in the same way that Reed and Sue have but without the wedlock and the super powered offspring. Ann and Jimmy both come to each others aid in time of need like you would expect a loving siblings to do but this concern for one another is not specific to the siblings as all four members have dropped the cause of battle to aid one of their own in one instance or another.</p><p>Unlike the Marvel's first family, there is and air of negativity and dis-functionality that aids in their undoing, time and time again.</p><h2>Story Arcs</h2><p>The U-Foes fought the <a href=\"/avengers-west-coast/4060-29075/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-29075\">West Coast Avengers</a> during the <a href=\"/acts-of-vengeance/4045-41931/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-41931\">Acts of Vengeance</a>.</p><h3>Civil War</h3><p>The U-Foes registered as part of the Superhuman Registration Act after they were apprehended by the <a href=\"/thunderbolts/4060-23977/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-23977\">Thunderbolts</a>.

Prof. Utrecht is a ruthless business man as well as being a Professor. Utrecht convinces three other people to join him in his quest to recreate Dr. Banners experiment. In the game Banner says he was tempted to go and speak to him when he first began working on the project. The army realizes what Utrecht is doing and sends a group of soldiers to arrest go an arrest him. Playing as the Hulk you must reach them and destroy them before they get to Utrecht because Banner needs to talk to him. A man named Rick Jones is an alley with you and radios you and tells you that there is a gamma radiation level coming from the top of Utrecht's apartment and if you don't destroy the dish then it could be a very bad thing for the city. Still playing as the Hulk you must rush to the apartment and destroy the satellite dish that is drawing the gamma energy. After doing so a small cut scene of the Hulk destroying the rest of the building shows and then the ufoes stand up and are amazed with the Hulk but decide he is a threat to them and he must be stopped. They will come at you by twos and try to kill you. They have all renamed themselves, Utrecht has named himself Vector. The others are named Vapor,Ironclad, and X-Ray. After finally defeating them a video will play of Vector promising that if the Hulk ever interferes again he must be killed. You will meet them randomly throughout the city later on.</p><p>In the 2012 turn based RPG social network game, Avengers Ultimate Alliance, the U-Foes are reoccurring enemies in chapter 4: You, Foe. Part 1 of chapter 4 has Ironclad and Vapor as bosses, Part 2 has X-Ray, part 3 has Vector, and Vapor is the last U-Foe to appear in the chapter in part 4, as a main boss, as the closing boss fight for chapter 4 part 5 features Doctor Doom as the boss rather the a member of the U-Foes.</p><h3>Television</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55582/1537835-animated_u_men.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1537835\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56222547584187\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55582/1537835-animated_u_men.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1537835\"><img alt=\"Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/55582/1537835-animated_u_men.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55582/1537835-animated_u_men.jpg 1366w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/55582/1537835-animated_u_men.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/55582/1537835-animated_u_men.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/55582/1537835-animated_u_men.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55582/1537835-animated_u_men.jpg 1366w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/55582/1537835-animated_u_men.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/55582/1537835-animated_u_men.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes</figcaption></figure><p>The U-Foes made their animated debut on <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/the-avengers-earths-mightiest-heroes/17-31304/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes</a>.

    "deck": "A worldwide subversive organization dedicated to global domination.  At its height, HYDRA was the most extensive, powerful, and dangerous organization in history.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Rising out of the fall of the Axis Powers in World War II, HYDRA was apparently created as a secret organization for global domination by Nazi spymaster <a href=\"/baron-von-strucker/4005-4662/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4662\">Baron Wolfgang von Strucker</a> along with <a href=\"/kraken/4005-60717/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-60717\">Kraken</a>. This developed with the help of an alliance with <a href=\"/shoji-soma/4005-76602/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-76602\">Shoji Soma</a>, grandmaster of the <a href=\"/the-hand/4060-1800/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-1800\">Hand</a>. When the power base pf HYDRA felt firmly established, Strucker installed himself as its supreme commander and ended the alliance with the Hand.</p><p>HYDRA recruited from the remnants of the Nazi's military forces and acquired alien technologies to advance its resources beyond those that most governments possessed. Strucker chose to build HYDRA\"s forces quietly over the following decades.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Hydra was created by <a href=\"/stan-lee/4040-40467/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\">Jack Kirby</a>. The first appearance of Hydra was in <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/strange-tales-135-the-man-for-the-job/4000-111069/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-111069\">Strange Tales #135</a>.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><p>Through the decades, HYDRA was consistently used as a source of all-purpose terrorism and villainous cannon fodder with its legions of uniformed operatives and its philosophy \"cut off one head and two will take its place.\" It also consistently served as an opposite number for <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a>, Marvel's source of all-purpose espionage and heroic cannon fodder.</p><p>A number of other criminal organizations began as branches of HYDRA before striking off as their own independent entities, such as <a href=\"/aim/4060-13497/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13497\">A.I.M.</a>, with its own various factions, and separate incarnations of the <a href=\"/secret-empire/4060-15136/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15136\">Secret Empire</a>.</p><p>Baron Von Strucker has most commonly depicted as HYDRA's \"Supreme Hydra.\" However, the organization fractured after his first death, leading to a variety of HYDRAs with an inconsistent hierarchy of leadership. This continued even after Strucker was resurrected and he supposedly reunited HYDRA. Others claiming the title of Supreme Hydra have included <a href=\"/viper/4005-3420/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3420\">Viper</a> and <a href=\"/gorgon/4005-3777/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3777\">the Gorgon</a>.</p><p>This was addressed in <a href=\"/secret-warriors/4050-25640/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-25640\"><i>Secret Warriors</i></a> by <a href=\"/jonathan-hickman/4040-45065/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-45065\">Jonathan Hickman</a>, who introduced the <a href=\"/hydra-high-council/4060-58039/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58039\">HYDRA High Council</a>. This embraced the sometimes inconsistent portrayals of HYDRA by rationalizing it as HYDRA now having a council-based leadership that including Von Strucker, Viper, Gorgon, <a href=\"/the-hive/4005-60718/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-60718\">the Hive</a>, Kraken and a new <a href=\"/contessa-valentina-allegro-de-la-fontaine/4005-23797/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23797\">Madame Hydra</a>. The structure of HYDRA was much more strongly defined through the course of this series but also heavily changed in the end due to an internal civil war. Much of the High Council was left either dead or defected, leaving HYDRA under the command of Gorgon and Madame HYDRA. The end of this series also revealed the role of Von Strucker's arch-foe, <a href=\"/\">Nick Fury</a>, in the birth of the organization.</p><p>Additionally, an extradimensional rift has allowed agents of HYDRA from an alternate Earth to appear on Earth-616. This version of the organization is firmly under the command of <a href=\"/\">Queen Hydra</a>.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Enemy of the State</h3><p><b>For further information:</b> <a href=\"/enemy-of-the-state/4045-55965/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55965\">Enemy of the State</a></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-265233\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/265233-167540-wolverine.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5225\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/265233-167540-wolverine.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-265233\"><img alt=\"Wolverine vs. Gorgon\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/265233-167540-wolverine.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/265233-167540-wolverine.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>Wolverine vs. Gorgon</figcaption></figure><p>In an alliance between HYDRA and the Hand, Baron Von Strucker orchestrated a plan that saw <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a> taken and killed by the Gorgon. Wolverine was then resurrected by the Hand's magic as a loyal agent of HYDRA. Wolverine was then sent on a killing spree in the superhuman and law enforcement communities in the service of HYDRA. Some of these superhumans were made into HYDRA agents using the same Hand magic that was used on Wolverine. Along the way, he also acquired defense secrets and <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Reed Richards</a>' technology for HYDRA. He was eventually brought down by a combined effort from the superhero community and freed of HYDRA's brainwashing. Despite this, HYDRA still accomplished a great deal.</p><p>All was not well within HYDRA, though. The Gorgon had entered into an affair with <a href=\"/elisbeth-von-strucker/4005-4661/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4661\">Elsbeth Von Strucker</a>, Baron Von Strucker's wife, and used this to depose him as the Supreme Hydra. Both HYDRA and the Hand were now under the Gorgon's command, and he focused on the part of Von Strucker's plan involving using the Hand's magic to recruit superhumans. He ordered the mass murder of both superheroes and supervillains alike so that their bodies could be revived as loyal HYDRA agents, quickly gathering together a small army.</p><p>However, S.H.I.E.L.D. had successfully deprogrammed Wolverine, and the mutant now wanted nothing but revenge. He tore through the Hand and Gorgon's former death cult, the Dawn of the White Light. He then came after Gorgon as he was carrying out a plan to assassinate Nick Fury. It was only Wolverine's last second intervention that prevented Gorgon from killing Fury, and Wolverine just barely managed to kill Gorgon, cutting off another head of HYDRA.</p><h3>The Seven Capital Cities of Heaven</h3><p>A man known simply as <a href=\"/xao/4005-52979/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52979\">Xao</a> formed an alliance with HYDRA in a plot to break through the mystical barrier separating Earth from <a href=\"/kun-lun/4020-56104/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56104\">K'un-Lun</a> and pillage the city of its ancient wonders.

Ironically, HYDRA was dealing with its own infiltrators around the same time, namely the <a href=\"/skrulls/4060-40668/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40668\">Skrulls</a>. Upon realization that he had been breached by the Skrulls, Strucker chose to completely destroyed his undersea base codenamed Ichor with all of its personnel. He then reconvened HYDRA at Gehenna, their most treasured stronghold, and called the full HYDRA High Council together. They even forced the Grandmaster of the Hand to resurrect the Gorgon to convene the full council of HYDRA's leaders.</p><p>So it was that Baron Strucker, Kraken, the Hive, the Gorgon, Madame Hydra and the Viper all met together for what was apparently the first time, and Strucker laid out his intentions. Fury had discovered their true structure and was going to come for them. Rather than wait, he wanted HYDRA to go to war with Fury. Though some were reluctant, there was unanimous consent for Strucker's war.</p><h3>Wake the Beast</h3><p><b>For further information:</b> <a href=\"/wake-the-beast/4045-56433/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56433\">Wake the Beast</a></p><p>HYDRA was betrayed by one of its leaders Madame Hydra, actually Contessa Allegro de la Fontaine. She was, in fact, a sleeper agent of <a href=\"/leviathan/4060-57417/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57417\">Leviathan</a>, an ancient enemy of HYDRA's dating back to the years of its very formation. She acquired from them an alien power source that could be used to awaken Leviathan's leader from stasis, and so rose <a href=\"/orion/4005-70203/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70203\">Orion</a>, leader of Leviathan. The two organizations met for what HYDRA hoped could be an understanding between them. Leviathan was not interested in any understanding, and so fierce war began between Leviathan and HYDRA.</p><p>All the while, Nick Fury and his small force of <a href=\"/secret-warriors/4060-54569/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-54569\">Secret Warriors</a> manipulated events to urge them on.</p><h3>Wheels Within Wheels</h3><p>HYDRA took heavy losses in the war with Leviathan, and this was made worse when Nick Fury and his Secret Warriors successfully destroyed Gehenna. The loss of this stronghold fractured HYDRA's leadership, and two factions clashed in an internal civil war. One side rallied behind the Gorgon and the other behind Kraken. This only increased HYDRA's losses, and it turned out this was all carefully orchestrated by Nick Fury. Kraken was not the original man who helped create HYDRA but was actually Jake Fury. HYDRA had been played into killing itself, and Nick Fury personally executed Strucker.</p><p>Though diminished, HYDRA managed to endure because Fury had not accounted in his plans for Gorgon's resurrection.

    "deck": "A U.N. affiliated intelligence agency dealing primarily with terrorism and superhuman threats that was originally founded by the U.S. government.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>S.H.I.E.L.D. was formed by <a href=\"/nick-fury/4005-3202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3202\">Nick Fury,</a> in the period after <a href=\"/world-war-ii/4015-56025/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56025\">World War II</a>. However, he figured the U.S. government wouldn't want a group like that, so he disbanded it. Later, though, after a terrorist attack, he noticed that a group like S.H.I.E.L.D. could really have helped and prevented the disaster. So he reformed it. Meanwhile, the <a href=\"/united-nations/4060-57235/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57235\">United Nations</a> had already taken S.H.I.E.L.D. and restarted it, having Colonel <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/rick-stoner/4005-83583/\">Rick Stoner</a> becoming the first Director of the organization. Fury immediately joined and rose to the top. The Nations had reformed it in response to a <a href=\"/hydra/4060-3480/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3480\">HYDRA</a> attack, and once Fury was leading it, it flourished.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>S.H.I.E.L.D. made their first appearance in <a href=\"/strange-tales/4050-18066/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18066\">Strange Tales</a> #135. They were created by <a href=\"../../stan-lee/26-40467/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"../../jack-kirby/26-5614/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jack Kirby.</a></p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><p>S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Hazard Intervention, Espionage and Logistics Directorate) or Supreme Headquarters International Espionage Law enforcement Division (see Iron Man #227) is a group affiliated with the U.N that deals with superhuman threats. It is an intelligence and anti-terrorism group similar to the <a href=\"/federal-bureau-of-investigation-fbi/4060-55443/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55443\">FBI</a>, only it is an international corporation that spans all the world. It acts like the police force. S.H.I.E.L.D. agents are armed and work well, much more effective then standard police. They fight terrorists as well as super humans. S.H.I.E.L.D. also has been responsible for the starting of spin-off groups like <a href=\"/sword/4060-41666/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41666\">S.W.O.R.D.</a> and <a href=\"/strike/4060-58524/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58524\">S.T.R.I.K.E.</a> S.H.I.E.L.D. has agents that also are higher level, that often are super humans. <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a>, <a href=\"/spider-woman/4005-1453/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1453\">Spider-Woman</a>, and <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man</a> all have operated as S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. S.H.I.E.L.D. keeps ties to the superhuman community, too-they often call on the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a>, the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a>, and <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a>.</p><p>S.H.I.E.L.D. has superhuman agents in the past-two teams were formed in an effort to make a S.H.I.E.L.D. superhuman team. The first team consisted of Marvel Man, <a href=\"/texas-twister/4005-10214/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10214\">Texas Twister</a>, the <a href=\"/vamp/4005-14409/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14409\">Vamp</a>, and <a href=\"/blue-streak/4005-14446/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14446\">Blue Streak</a>. However, it quickly failed, and another team in the same vein also failed. The Psi-Division of S.H.I.E.L.D. is a group of psychics or telepaths that deal with psionic menaces. This is only one of the groups of super humans that work in S.H.I.E.L.D. for the greater good.</p><p>All S.H.I.E.L.D. members have a certain level, based on their importance. A normal S.H.I.E.L.D. agent will have a Level One-which means he can pass through Level One areas and has clearance. A sergeant might have Level Two, which means he has Level Two and One clearance. The Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. has a Level Nine clearance. Level Ten means the most important person in the world-no one currently possesses a Level Ten clearance. Not even the President, or Nick Fury.</p><p>S.H.I.E.L.D. has many bases around the world. Many are on land-most notably S.H.I.E.L.D. Central, which is located in <a href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\">New York City</a>. There are also many shelters that are secretly placed around the world. Fury has used one, as has the <a href=\"/secret-avengers/4060-40904/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40904\">Secret Avengers</a> when they needed a base during the events of Civil War. However, their most famous and important base is the <a href=\"/shield-helicarrier/4055-40700/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40700\">S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier</a>.</p><h3><a href=\"/shield-helicarrier/4055-40700/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40700\">Helicarrier</a></h3><p>The Helicarrier is an aircraft that is constantly in the air. It is huge enough to hold an aircraft carrier. It is the mobile headquarters of S.H.I.E.L.D. and is extremely protected. The Helicarrier has held an entire squadron of jet fighters and a nuclear ballistic missile. There is one major Helicarrier, which is the one that is most important and used. There are also many smaller Helicarriers, however, which all serve as bases too. The Helicarrier has an extremely high level of security-even if someone managed to get on without clearance, guards and extremely powerful security technology would have them gone in a second. The Helicarrier was first proposed by <a href=\"/stark-industries/4060-56840/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56840\">Stark Industries</a>, and was designed by <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Tony Stark</a>, <a href=\"/forge/4005-4279/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4279\">Forge</a>, and <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Mr. Fantastic</a>.</p><p>S.H.I.E.L.D. operated as a covert, military/intelligence agency at the time, and members of it had already appeared. S.H.I.E.L.D. already fought HYDRA then-the evil group had plots like the aforementioned \"Overkill Horn\". <a href=\"/aim/4060-13497/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13497\">A.I.M.</a> made its first appearance, and individual villains such as <a href=\"/red-skull/4005-2250/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2250\">Red Skull</a> also popped up and needed to be stopped by S.H.I.E.L.D.. At this time, Godzilla came, and the <a href=\"/godzilla-squad/4060-57924/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57924\">Godzilla Squad</a> was formed to take the monster down. S.H.I.E.L.D. had tough periods during this time. Several lifelike robots got so smart that they became able to think and make choices-they became sentient beings. They had a grudge against S.H.I.E.L.D. for making them follow orders all the time before they had intelligence-so they drugged important S.H.I.E.L.D. members and took their place within the organization. Several of these were <a href=\"/contessa-valentina-allegra-de-la-fontaine/4005-23797/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23797\">Contessa Valentina Allegra de la Fontaine</a>, <a href=\"/jimmy-woo/4005-7530/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7530\">Jimmy Woo</a>, and <a href=\"/jasper-sitwell/4005-7529/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7529\">Jasper Sitwell</a>, among others. However, the valiant Fury managed to take them down.</p><h3>Fury's Influence</h3><p>Most of the reason that S.H.I.E.L.D. was so effective started with <a href=\"/nick-fury/4005-3202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3202\">Fury</a>. He started the group and put good, effective agents in place. He was extremely popular in and out of S.H.I.E.L.D. and had strong ties with the hero community. Without him, many \"pessimists\" and intellectuals theorized that S.H.I.E.L.D. would fall, and fall hard.</p><p>Unfortunately, they were right. S.H.I.E.L.D. ran into disastrous times. As aforementioned, Nick Fury did a mission in <a href=\"/latveria/4020-41031/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41031\">Latveria</a> to stop them from attacking the U.S. However, it was totally unauthorized, and Fury was forced to resign from S.H.I.E.L.D. Warrants went out for his arrest. The new head of S.H.I.E.L.D. was <a href=\"/maria-hill/4005-40824/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40824\">Maria Hill</a>-who proved to be incompetent at the position. The President of the U.S. was a driving force behind Hill's election-for two reasons. Hill was an American, so the President expected her to be loyal first and foremost to the U.S. even though S.H.I.E.L.D. was a United Nations facility. Also, many men and women had been members of S.H.I.E.L.D. for a long time, and they would have been much better as the head of S.H.I.E.L.D.. However, they were \"too loyal to Fury\", so Hill got the job to keep the Fury loyalists out.</p><p>S.H.I.E.L.D. took a downward turn. Fury's work as the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. was extremely effective, and an insane amount of work had kept corruption out of the huge organization. Unfortunately, Hill wasn't as good as Fury at it, and S.H.I.E.L.D. became corrupt and weak. Crimes were committed. Criminals were \"stockpiled\" in prison. Worst of all, the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a> discovered that someone was mining the anti-metal in the <a href=\"/savage-land/4020-21766/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-21766\">Savage Land</a> using slave labor-and S.H.I.E.L.D. was the prime suspect.</p><h3>Subdivisions</h3><p>S.H.I.E.L.D. also has many subdivisions and other groups based off it. Two other groups have been formed from S.H.I.E.L.D.; <a href=\"../../sword/65-41666/\" rel=\"nofollow\">S.W.O.R.D</a>.,<a href=\"/safe/4020-56459/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56459\">S.A.F.E.</a>, to <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/armor/4060-53864/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-53864\">A.R.M.O.R</a>. .</p><p>S.W.O.R.D. stands for Sentient World Observation and Response Department. As you can easily guess, S.W.O.R.D. works with extraterrestrials. It stops extraterrestrial threats, keeps tabs on powerful aliens, etc. They are not a subdivision of S.H.I.E.L.D. but are actually a separate, yet similar group that simply works with S.H.I.E.L.D. However, they are closely affiliated with both S.H.I.E.L.D. and the United Nations. S.W.O.R.D. encountered <a href=\"/ord/4005-4445/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4445\">Ord</a>, an alien who was convinced that a mutant from Earth was destined to destroy his planet. He attempted to attack Earth to kill all the mutants but S.W.O.R.D. and the <a href=\"../../x-men/65-3173/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men</a> stopped him, effectively stopping an interplanetary war. The leader of S.W.O.R.D. is <a href=\"../../abigail-brand/29-4441/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Abigail Brand</a>, a tough, effective leader who stopped many crises and is extremely valuable to S.H.I.E.L.D. She was a Fury loyalist and respected him a lot and greatly dislikes Maria Hill. As for Tony Stark, he has not encountered S.W.O.R.D. or Brand yet. S.W.O.R.D. is currently trying to stop another war with a planet called <a href=\"/breakworld/4020-42278/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42278\">Breakworld</a>.</p><p>Since S.H.I.E.L.D. is loyal to the United Nations two countries have created their own answer to S.H.I.E.L.D. that works within their country and their country alone. The first to appear was the British version of S.H.I.E.L.D., <a href=\"/strike/4060-58524/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58524\">S.T.R.I.K.E.</a> (Special Tactical Reserve for International Key Emergencies). S.T.R.I.K.E. was British, but one of their early leaders, Tod Radcliffe, was revealed to be a traitor that worked for the <a href=\"/red-skull/4005-2250/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2250\">Red Skull</a>. The next leader was <a href=\"/lance-hunter/4005-9122/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9122\">Lance Hunter</a>. They worked closely with <a href=\"../../captain-britain/29-7477/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Captain Britain</a>. However, <a href=\"/vixen/4005-14890/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14890\">Vixen</a> (Captain Britain's enemy) took them over and S.T.R.I.K.E. was disbanded. The most prominent person to work for S.T.R.I.K.E. was <a href=\"/psylocke/4005-3176/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3176\">Betsy Braddock</a>, who had psychic powers. After leaving S.T.R.I.K.E.. she joined the X-Men as the heroine Psylocke.</p><p>S.A.F.E. is the United States answer to S.H.I.E.L.D. The name stands for Strategic Action For Emergencies. S.A.F.E. is nearly identical to S.H.I.E.L.D., except they are only in the U.S. They have fought many enemies, including <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Doctor Doom</a> and <a href=\"../../baron-heinrich-zemo/29-3708/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Baron Heinrich Zemo</a>. The leader is Sean Morgan, a competent leader and good soldier. Joshua Ballard is the most prolific agent, and he's extremely helpful-he's the <a href=\"/dum-dum-dugan/4005-3526/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3526\">Dum Dum Dugan</a> of S.A.F.E..</p><p>Along with these agencies, other small groups have been formed including Euromind and Starcore.</p><p>Another group that has continually showed up over the years is the Cape Killers. They were never an official S.H.I.E.L.D. group, but S.H.I.E.L.D. agents did make up it's ranks. The term Cape Killers was given to any group of soldiers trained to hunt, subdue and in worst case scenario kill meta humans. The Cape Killers have had such members as <a href=\"/agent-abrams/4005-68471/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-68471\">Agent Abrams</a>, Agent Cleery, <a href=\"/dum-dum-dugan/4005-3526/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3526\">Dum Dum Dugan</a>, &amp; Special Agent Marquez, and her partner Agent McAllister.</p><h3>Members</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11746/916245-prv3173_pg4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-916245\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.54375\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11746/916245-prv3173_pg4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-916245\"><img alt=\"Nick Fury\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11746/916245-prv3173_pg4.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11746/916245-prv3173_pg4.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px\" data-width=\"621\"></a><figcaption>Nick Fury</figcaption></figure><p>The most prominent, important, and effective member of S.H.I.E.L.D. is the man who runs it all, <a href=\"/nick-fury/4005-3202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3202\">Nick Fury</a>. Fury was born in <a href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\">New York City</a> in 1921, to decorated <a href=\"/world-war-i/4015-56026/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56026\">World War I</a> pilot Jack Fury. He and his friend <a href=\"/red-hargrove/4005-5178/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5178\">Red Hargrove</a> lusted after adventure-so they joined the U.S. Army in <a href=\"/world-war-ii/4015-56025/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56025\">World War II</a>. Nick was an adept soldier, and he was given command of the First Attack Squad-nicknamed the <a href=\"/howling-commandos/4060-32653/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-32653\">Howling Commandos</a>. The Howling Commandos were extremely effective-and Fury quickly became a decorated war hero.</p><p>After the war, Fury was hit by a land mine and badly injured. The government decided to test a new formula on him-that would heal him and greatly retard his aging. This was called the <a href=\"/infinity-formula/4015-43534/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-43534\">Infinity Formula</a>. It worked-Fury was restored to full strength and is still in his physical prime today. He eventually joined the CIA and became a CIA agent in Korea, also interacting with the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a>. <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Tony Stark</a> hired him to be the second commander of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Fury excelled at the job. Under his leadership, S.H.I.E.L.D. grew and grew until it is now one of the most powerful organizations in the world. Fury led S.H.I.E.L.D. for over forty years, working tirelessly and keeping it powerful and secret.</p><p>However, Fury recently discovered that <a href=\"/latveria/4020-41031/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41031\">Latveria</a>, led by the evil <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Doctor Doom</a>, was planning to attack America. He immediately had S.H.I.E.L.D. launch a covert assault on the country, effectively stopping the massive attack that would have taken place. A year later, Latveria attacked back, and thousands were killed. Fury was blamed-and <a href=\"/luke-cage/4005-1450/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1450\">Luke Cage</a> was injured. <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a> was angered at Fury. Eventually, this culminated in Fury being fired as commander of S.H.I.E.L.D.. A warrant was put out for his arrest, and <a href=\"/\">Maria Hill</a> took his place as the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. Hill still leads S.H.I.E.L.D. and Fury is still in hiding. He keeps control over parts of S.H.I.E.L.D. and lent a base to the <a href=\"/secret-avengers/4060-40904/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40904\">Secret Avengers</a> during <a href=\"/civil-war/4045-40615/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40615\">Civil War</a>.</p><p>Nick Fury is infused with the Infinity Formula, meaning he barely ages at all. He is an soldier, with lots of experience as both a warrior and a leader. He is a master tactician and strategist, and is very good with all sorts of weapons. He wields great political power as the head of S.H.I.E.L.D., and is a very good hand-to-hand combatant.</p><p>Nick Fury is not the only S.H.I.E.L.D. agent-not by a long shot. Many of the other important S.H.I.E.L.D. members date back from Fury's old team-the Howling Commandos.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4312/141426-170316-dum-dum-dugan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-141426\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.796\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:79.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4312/141426-170316-dum-dum-dugan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-141426\"><img alt=\"Dum Dum Dugan\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4312/141426-170316-dum-dum-dugan.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4312/141426-170316-dum-dum-dugan.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></a><figcaption>Dum Dum Dugan</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"../../dum-dum-dugan/29-3526/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dum Dum Dugan</a> (Timothy Aloysius Cadwallader Dugan) was working as a circus strongman before he enlisted in World War II. He was put in the Howling Commandos, a new division led by Nick Fury. He was extremely valuable to the team-he was so strong that he was able to save them from many things that should have killed them. He was a great marksman, strongman, and leader, and he became Fury's second-in-command. When the war ended, Fury invited Dugan into S.H.I.E.L.D. as his second-in-command. Dugan has easily been the second-most-important person to S.H.I.E.L.D. His missions have included tracking down and killing a radioactive monster ( <a href=\"/\">Godzilla</a>, in the <a href=\"/godzilla-squad/4060-57924/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57924\">Godzilla Squad</a>) and various independent missions to take super villains (often with <a href=\"/squirrel-girl/4005-2488/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2488\">Squirrel Girl</a>). For a long time, he worked maintaining security on the Helicarrier, and working for Fury whenever needed. When Fury was replaced by Maria Hill, he was her second-in-command and was put in charge of mutant affairs. This involved conflicts with <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a>, who he had a mysterious contact with. Eventually, he tried to resign from S.H.I.E.L.D. when Tony Stark took control. He was rejected-he was too important to S.H.I.E.L.D. to quit. He was recently shot in the chest by <a href=\"/daken/4005-42501/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42501\">Daken</a>, but he survived, and is currently in the hospital.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9241/804114-001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-804114\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.0127118644068\" data-width=\"236\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 236px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:101.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9241/804114-001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-804114\"><img alt=\"Gabriel Jones\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px\" data-width=\"236\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9241/804114-001.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9241/804114-001.jpg 236w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Gabriel Jones\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9241/804114-001.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9241/804114-001.jpg 236w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px\" data-width=\"236\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Gabriel Jones</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"../../gabriel-jones/29-13836/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gabriel Jones</a> was a young African-American living in <a href=\"/\">New York City</a> when a little thing called World War II popped up.

After the war was over, Jones served on the Godzilla Squad with other former Howling Commandos (not Fury), and later joined S.H.I.E.L.D. He ran out missions with or without other agents for S.H.I.E.L.D. until he retired, due to the events in the miniseries \"Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D..\" He remains retired today, living the quiet, peaceful life. He sure deserves that.

As a young girl, Sharon loved hearing stories of her older sister Peggy, who was a World War 1 flying ace and freedom fighter. Peggy had worked with Captain America, and the two fell in love. However, Cap never learned her name, and he then froze in suspended animation. Sharon was a good fighter and loved justice, so she joined S.H.I.E.L.D. under the code-name \"Agent 13\" and ran out several missions for them. She kept crossing paths with Cap, who had been resurrected and they eventually fell in love. Cap wanted her to quit as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, but she refused. Eventually, her death was faked so she could be sent off on a top-secret mission. The mission failed, and she was presumed dead. Cap was never informed that her death was faked the first time. However, he eventually found her, and she rejoined S.H.I.E.L.D.. She now works as a high-level agent, reporting directly to Hill for missions. Recently, she was given a hypnotic suggestion by <a href=\"/doctor-faustus/4005-34185/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-34185\">Dr. Faustus</a> to help kill Captain America, and under hypnotism, shot him in the stomach after <a href=\"/crossbones/4005-3225/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3225\">Crossbones</a>, a sniper and <a href=\"/red-skull/4005-2250/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2250\">Red Skull's</a> henchman, shot him.

Most of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s enemies are big groups-and the most powerful, fearsome, and deadly one of them all is HYDRA. HYDRA is S.H.I.E.L.D.'s archenemy. The motto of the group is \"Cut off one of our heads, and two more will take it's place!\" This is a reference to the Ancient Greek monster called the hydra, which fought <a href=\"../../hercules/29-2503/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hercules</a> and had the same ability. HYDRA is a terrorist group dedicated to taking over the world and destroying S.H.I.E.L.D., which has foiled them many a time.</p><p>HYDRA has actually been around for centuries. The group goes all the way back to Imperial Japan, which only sought to rule Japan. This all changed in the 1900s when <a href=\"/baron-von-strucker/4005-4662/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4662\">Wolfgang Von Strucker</a> joined the group. Strucker was insane, deluded, and powerful-and he quickly rose to the top of the group. he steered it away from Japan and decided on a new goal-rule the world! When he got to the top, he changed his name and got a title-he became Baron Strucker. HYDRA was originally very open, not quiet, and S.H.I.E.L.D. was actually specifically formed to fight it (as you will read later). HYDRA and S.H.I.E.L.D. became enemies-constantly warring to take each other down. HYDRA made several daring moves. Strucker invented the \"Overkill Horn\", which would detonate all nuclear explosives worldwide. Later came the biological \"Death-Spore Bomb\". Both plots were foiled by S.H.I.E.L.D., and the latter resulted in Strucker's death.</p><p>After Baron Strucker died, HYDRA split into many mini-groups, or \"heads\" of HYDRA. Some of these were East Coast HYDRA, Las Vegas HYDRA, New York HYDRA, and Germany HYDRA. These factions also genetically created super agents for HYDRA, resulting in the creation of many villains. However, this backfired when the great hero Spider-Woman was created by HYDRA related. Eventually Strucker was revived, and he reunited HYDRA. They continued their war against S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Earth.</p><p>HYDRA later planned a massive attack on the U.S-they smuggled nuclear missile into America and was going to launch a bio nuclear assault on a major aquifer. They also tried to brainwash an army of heroes and villains (including <a href=\"../../elektra/29-1802/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elektra</a> and <a href=\"../../northstar/29-3190/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Northstar</a>). Both times, they were foiled by S.H.I.E.L.D. and the <a href=\"../../new-avengers/65-42520/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New Avengers</a> (including Spider-Woman, who they created). HYDRA is still extremely dangerous, and cannot be stopped easily. The only reason they don't currently rule the world is because of the heroic efforts of S.H.I.E.L.D..</p><p>The HYDRA Agent is similar to the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. He is extremely well-trained-only the elite become agents. They carry a large variety of weapons and are trained especially in stealth. HYDRA Agents often get missions to detonate, destroy, beat up, or burn things, and they are superb fighters. Some Agents of HYDRA have been <a href=\"/red-skull/4005-2250/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2250\">Red Skull</a>, <a href=\"../../spider-woman/29-1453/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Woman</a>, <a href=\"../../kingpin/29-1483/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kingpin</a>, and many others.</p><h3><a href=\"/aim/4060-13497/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13497\">A.I.M.</a></h3><p>Although HYDRA is easily S.H.I.E.L.D.'s greatest enemy, it is by no means the only one. One of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s other enemies is A.I.M.</p><p>A.I.M. (Advanced Idea Mechanics) was created as a subdivision of HYDRA, by Baron Strucker. A.I.M.'s purpose was to create new technological wonders for HYDRA to use against S.H.I.E.L.D. and to take over the world. It is a group of scientists, industrialists, and technological geniuses, and originally, they provided and designed weapons, defenses, and huge assault mechanisms for HYDRA. However, HYDRA suffered a huge defeat from the U.S and Japan Armies, so A.I.M. broke off into it's own group. Like HYDRA, A.I.M.'s goal is to rule the Earth. However, unlike HYDRA, who wants to do it by force, A.I.M. seeks domination by technological means. They have created huge weapons and marvels before, and share one trait with HYDRA-they are dedicated to destroying S.H.I.E.L.D.. A.I.M. was led by the <a href=\"/scientist-supreme/4015-55957/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55957\">Scientist Supreme</a>, an evil, shadowy figure where very little about him is known by S.H.I.E.L.D..</p><p>The <a href=\"../../cosmic-cube/18-40949/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cosmic Cube</a> was an intensely powerful item as it could literally alter reality to the user's whim. Red Skull once stole it and wreaked havoc with it, but that was later. The Cube was created by the scientists at A.I.M., who sought to use it to rule the world. However, the Cube actually evolved into a new creature, <a href=\"../../kubik/29-20022/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kubik</a>, and A.I.M. no longer controls it. In this vein, A.I.M. created the <a href=\"../../super-adaptoid/29-10861/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Super-Adaptoid</a>, which could exactly mimic the powers and appearance of other superheroes and villains. Although it was immensely powerful, the Adaptoid contained a sliver of the Cosmic Cube that gave it its power. When the Cube became Kubik, it wanted the shard back, so it easily destroyed the creature and regained the sliver. A.I.M. also created <a href=\"/modok/4005-3709/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3709\">M.O.D.O.K.</a> (Mobile Organism Designed Only for Killing). M.O.D.O.K. was originally one of AIM's own scientists, and he took control of A.I.M. and improved it, continuing the fight to rule the world and destroy S.H.I.E.L.D.. M.O.D.O.K. still is in charge of A.I.M. Along with A.I.M., some of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s enemies are <a href=\"../../zodiac/65-41170/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zodiac</a> and Godzilla.</p><p>Zodiac is a criminal organization that was created using S.H.I.E.L.D. technology. Each member is another sign of the Zodiac, and they are dedicated to world domination. Although the Zodiac mostly fights the Avengers, they often collide with S.H.I.E.L.D. in their efforts to have the world ruled by their criminal organization.</p><p>Godzilla was a radioactive monster that rose out of the waters of Tokyo, Japan. S.H.I.E.L.D. immediately responded to the crisis, and formed the Godzilla Squad out of some of its members. The Squad was led by Dum Dum Dugan (who never fully recovered from the experience), and its mission was to take down Godzilla! Godzilla caused lots of property damage around Asia and North America before it was finally driven back into the sea. Obviously, this is based on the Japanese movie in real life of the same name-minus the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3><a href=\"/civil-war/4045-40615/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40615\">Civil War</a></h3><p>The Civil War started when the <a href=\"/new-warriors/4060-11896/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-11896\">New Warriors</a> (consisting of <a href=\"/speedball/4005-2104/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2104\">Robbie Baldwin</a>, <a href=\"/namorita/4005-2113/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2113\">Namorita</a>, <a href=\"/microbe/4005-40859/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40859\">Microbe</a>, and <a href=\"/night-thrasher/4005-2098/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2098\">Night Thrasher</a>) went on a basic mission to catch four criminals in an old house.

Namorita stopped him, but he let off an explosion, destroying <a href=\"/stamford-ct/4020-45571/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-45571\">Stamford</a> and murdering 600 people.</p><p><a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Tony Stark</a>, also known as Iron Man, proposed the <a href=\"/super-human-registration-act/4015-40639/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40639\">Superhuman Registration Act</a>, where all super humans would have to register their powers and identities. They'd basically be cops. <a href=\"/maria-hill/4005-40824/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40824\">Maria Hill</a>, who was the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. supported the Act, and eventually it was passed. Many super humans disagreed with the Act, the most important and prolific being <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a>. S.H.I.E.L.D. was enlisted by the U.S. government-take down Cap and his anti-registration hero team, the <a href=\"/\">Secret Avengers</a>. New S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents, nicknamed cape-killers, went after anti-reg heroes. S.H.I.E.L.D. was led by Maria Hill, and was fully pro-reg. Iron Man worked closely with S.H.I.E.L.D. also-he revealed his identity as Tony Stark. Many battles were fought. Eventually, Tony Stark's pro-registration side-and S.H.I.E.L.D. won. However, Maria Hill found out why she had been made the head of S.H.I.E.L.D., as aforementioned-to keep more effective \"Fury loyalists\" out and be loyal to the U.S. She was not supposed to be effective, and she wasn't. Dismayed, she turned leadership of S.H.I.E.L.D. over to the man she thought deserved it most-Tony Stark. Stark, also Iron Man, is currently the leader and head of S.H.I.E.L.D..</p><h3><a href=\"/hammer/4060-56065/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56065\">H.A.M.M.E.R.</a></h3><p>In the fallout of Secret Invasion <a href=\"/norman-osborn/4005-58812/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\">Norman Osborn</a> is granted the keys to the whole world and closes down S.H.I.E.L.D. and replaces it with his own special forces known as <a href=\"/hammer/4060-56065/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56065\">H.A.M.M.E.R.</a> He also replaces all of the organization's <a href=\"/stark-industries/4060-56840/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56840\">Stark</a> Tech (which had been compromised during the <a href=\"/secret-invasion/4045-47264/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-47264\"><em>Secret Invasion</em></a>) with technology and weapons created by <a href=\"/osborn-industries/4060-58700/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58700\">Oscorp</a>.</p><p>Nick Fury also discovers a dark secret about who as been pulling S.H.I.E.L.D.'s strings the whole time he was an agent in <a href=\"/secret-warriors/4060-54569/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-54569\"><em>Secret Warriors</em> </a>#1.</p><h2>Weapons and Equipment</h2><p>S.H.I.E.L.D. has a lot of technology, important technology that is often used. Perhaps the most important is the LMD- <a href=\"../../life-model-decoy/18-42286/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Life Model Decoy</a>. The Life Model Decoy is an android that is absolutely indistinguishable from whoever it impersonates. Fingerprints, DNA, hair, speech, thought patterns (for telepaths), anything, the Decoy is exactly the same. However, it is an android. LMDs are used to duplicate people and take their place if they are going to be assassinated or there is a strong chance of an attack. LMDs have been used in place of personnel since the beginning of the organization, including Jessica Drew. Most often, they have been used as a substitute for Nick Fury, who has had at least five LMDs destroyed in attempts to have him killed. These robots are a lot of the reason that many key S.H.I.E.L.D. members are still alive. The <a href=\"/zodiac/4060-41170/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41170\">Zodiac</a>, a criminal organization, was created using stolen S.H.I.E.L.D. LMDs. Also, LMDs have gained sentience a few times. The <a href=\"/deltites/4060-59033/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59033\">Deltites</a> were a group of LMDs that gained sentience and tried to infiltrate S.H.I.E.L.D.. They were narrowly defeated by Nick Fury.</p><p>S.H.I.E.L.D. also has used robot exoskeletons and gargantuan robots to achieve its ends. <a href=\"../../red-ronin/29-33761/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Red Ronin</a> is the most important of those. Red Ronin was a huge, super powerful robot that was used by the Godzilla Squad. The robot was destroyed by Godzilla before he was driven into the sea. It was rebuilt, but was hijacked by a mad scientist who was trying to start World War Three. It was stopped by the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a> and S.H.I.E.L.D. regained the remains. It has been stolen and used for evil many times, by <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Dr. Doom</a>, <a href=\"../../the-hand/65-1800/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Hand</a>, and <a href=\"../../henry-gyrich/29-9711/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Henry Gyrich</a>. Each time, the robot has been defeated and rebuilt (by heroes like <a href=\"../../wasp/29-1502/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wasp</a> and <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a>)-only to be stolen again. Red Ronin is currently possessed and used by the evil villain <a href=\"/the-fixer/4005-16830/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-16830\">The Fixer</a>-it appears that the cycle is still going.</p><p>Of course, the most prolific technology created and used by S.H.I.E.L.D. is the Helicarrier. The Helicarrier is outfitted with weapons, security, and is constantly filled with S.H.I.E.L.D. agents who are extremely effective and good fighters. The Helicarrier is always being attacked by villains, and they are barely ever successful. Read more about the Helicarrier at the top of the page. A smaller version of the Helicarrier, the Behemoth, is often used by S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents on missions, including by the Squad and by <a href=\"/dum-dum-dugan/4005-3526/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3526\">Dum Dum Dugan</a>. The Behemoth is similar to the Helicarrier, only there is less weapons, technology, and it isn't as fast or powerful.</p><p>As for other technology, S.H.I.E.L.D. has access to an infinite amount of military-level tech. Tools, weapons, anything that's used, S.H.I.E.L.D. can get. Anything from pistols to nuclear weapons is easily attainable. Fighter jets are often used by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents when it is necessary for their mission.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3>Ultimate Universe (Earth-1610)</h3><p>In the Ultimate Marvel universe, S.H.I.E.L.D. was started and first led by <a href=\"../../general-thunderbolt-ross/29-3457/\" rel=\"nofollow\">General Thunderbolt Ross</a>, who is a major enemy of the <a href=\"../../hulk/29-2267/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hulk</a>. S.H.I.E.L.D. funded and sanctioned projects like <a href=\"../../weapon-x/65-5018/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Weapon X</a>, which created <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a>. A now-black <a href=\"/nick-fury/4005-3202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3202\">Nick Fury</a> took control of the group and was very effective. He tried to recreate the Super Soldier program, making another <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a>. the project failed and the formula turned the lead scientist on the project, <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Bruce Banner</a>, into the Hulk. S.H.I.E.L.D. tried again with the Oz formula. It was responsible for the creation of <a href=\"../../spider-man/29-1443/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Man</a>, <a href=\"../../green-goblin/29-1484/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Green Goblin</a>, <a href=\"../../sandman/29-3544/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sandman</a>, and <a href=\"/electro/4005-3228/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3228\">Electro</a>.</p><p>Also, Ultimate S.H.I.E.L.D. created the <a href=\"../../ultimates/65-40504/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ultimates</a>, as the government enlisted Fury to create a strike force of government-sponsored superheroes. The force was similar to the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a> in the 616 universe, and answers to Ultimate S.H.I.E.L.D..</p><h3>Marvel Zombiverse (Earth-2149)</h3><p>S.H.I.E.L.D. also appears in Marvel Zombies Universe. At first, some of the members are already infected by the virus when Sentry came to Earth infected. The first of the members infected were Colonel America, <a href=\"../../ms-marvel/29-21561/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ms. Marvel</a>, <a href=\"../../hawkeye/29-1475/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hawkeye</a>, and <a href=\"../../black-widow/29-3200/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Widow</a>. <a href=\"/luke-cage/4005-1450/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1450\">Luke Cage</a> is part of the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a>. After these infections, it starts to go on from there, with the infected heroes infecting other heroes and villains while eating people completely. <a href=\"../../daredevil/29-24694/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Daredevil</a> becomes infected by <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man</a> after saving <a href=\"../../nova/29-2105/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nova</a> and Nova is saved by the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a> and <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a> and goes to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. S.H.I.E.L.D. has called all uninfected heroes to meet together with Nick Fury and Nick Fury tells the uninfected heroes that they must make a defensive stand against the infected. The heroes agree to this, S.H.I.E.L.D. Avengers, and many more alike, and they go fight the zombies. However, this ends in tragedy and the uninfected become infected by the virus. The heroes were no match for the zombies and they all subdue to infection, becoming one of them. S.H.I.E.L.D. becomes no more and all of the members are killed or infected.</p><h3>Mutant X (Earth-1298)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/661527-107103_18073_108376_1_x_men_2099_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-661527\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.52\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/661527-107103_18073_108376_1_x_men_2099_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-661527\"><img alt=\"S.H.I.E.L.D. 2099\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/40/661527-107103_18073_108376_1_x_men_2099_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/661527-107103_18073_108376_1_x_men_2099_super.jpg 400w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/40/661527-107103_18073_108376_1_x_men_2099_super.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"S.H.I.E.L.D. 2099\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/40/661527-107103_18073_108376_1_x_men_2099_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/661527-107103_18073_108376_1_x_men_2099_super.jpg 400w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/40/661527-107103_18073_108376_1_x_men_2099_super.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>S.H.I.E.L.D. 2099</figcaption></figure><p>In this reality, S.H.I.E.L.D. now stands for Save Humanity by Intervention in the Evolution of Life-form Deviants.

After much planning, expense and hard work; the ship was built and was nearing its launch date. However, as the launch neared, the federal government was about to cut funding for the flight. Reed decided there was no choice but to launch the ship before the whole effort was scrapped and wasted.</p><p>Reed invited his girlfriend Susan Storm along for the trip and her brother Johnny Storm insisted on coming along in order to keep her safe. Wanting a pilot with both the ability and the guts to make the flight, Reed turned to his former college roommate and very close friend Ben Grimm, a highly accomplished former test pilot for the United States Air Force. The crew now set, everyone was ready for launch when Reed received a warning from the authorities concerning the effects of the cosmic rays on human bodies so far out in space. Reed's request for launch was denied and the mission aborted.</p><p>More desperate than ever to make the flight, Reed's crew waited until the changing of the guards that night and then sneaked onto the ship and launched before any planes could be scrambled to intercept them and/or shoot them down using missiles. Successful in leaving the Earth's atmosphere, they were halfway along on their mission when they entered a sub-space storm and were bombarded by intense cosmic rays both before they expected and stronger than they expected. This unexpectedly intense cosmic ray storm had strange and disorienting effects on the crew, making them unable to continue the trip. They turned back, returned to Earth and crash-landed in a small opening in a forested area.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1248591-2163445905_4a784aae01_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1248591\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.70032573289902\" data-width=\"614\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 614px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1248591-2163445905_4a784aae01_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1248591\"><img alt=\"The Birth of the Fantastic Four\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1248591-2163445905_4a784aae01_o.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1248591-2163445905_4a784aae01_o.jpg 614w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/1248591-2163445905_4a784aae01_o.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1248591-2163445905_4a784aae01_o.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>The Birth of the Fantastic Four</figcaption></figure><p>Luckily, they survived the crash but were radically changed.

Gathering their wits, they soon managed to calm themselves and agreed to use their new-found powers for the good of humanity and stay together as a team. Johnny called himself the \" <a href=\"/human-torch/4005-2120/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2120\"> Human Torch</a>,\" Sue took the name \"Invisible Girl\" (and later changed it to the <a href=\"/invisible-woman/4005-2190/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2190\"> Invisible Woman</a>). Ben chose the name \" <a href=\"/thing/4005-2114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2114\"> Thing\"</a> and Reed decided to call himself \" <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\"> Mr. Fantastic</a>.\" Thus, the Fantastic Four were born.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Fantastic Four was created by <a href=\"/stan-lee/4040-40467/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\"> Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\"> Jack Kirby</a> in <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4050-2045/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2045\"> Fantastic Four</a> #1, November 1961.

While this is no doubt true, it has also been rumored for years that Stan actually patterned the FF team after DC's Sea Devils team and The Challengers of the unknown. Looking at the composition of both teams, there are a lot of similarities, so this rumor could well be correct.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><h3>Silver Age</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1189434-ff_vs_mm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1189434\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.93169877408056\" data-width=\"571\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 571px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1189434-ff_vs_mm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1189434\"><img alt=\"The Fantastic Four v.s Mole Man\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64409/1189434-ff_vs_mm.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1189434-ff_vs_mm.jpg 571w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/64409/1189434-ff_vs_mm.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64409/1189434-ff_vs_mm.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Fantastic Four v.s Mole Man\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64409/1189434-ff_vs_mm.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1189434-ff_vs_mm.jpg 571w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/64409/1189434-ff_vs_mm.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64409/1189434-ff_vs_mm.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Fantastic Four v.s Mole Man</figcaption></figure><p>The first family super team of Marvel Comics, the <b>Fantastic Four</b> opened up the genre to a whole new way of telling the old story of family binds above all else. The Fantastic Four as a team made their public debut when a villain named <a href=\"/mole-man/4005-2481/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2481\"> Mole Man</a> (A villain that lives underground) began attacking the surface. The Fantastic Four continued their illustrious careers as superheroes and unlike <a href=\"../../spider-man/29-1443/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Spider-Man</a>, they were well loved by the public and the media by appearing on television and more.</p><p>Reed Richards also created the “ <a href=\"/unstable-molecules/4055-54225/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-54225\"> unstable molecules</a>” which are used for their costumes. This allows Reed’s costume to stretch as he does, Invisible Girl’s goes invisible when she does, and Human Torch’s doesn't burn up when he flames on. Reed would also discover <a href=\"/the-negative-zone/4020-40699/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40699\"> The Negative Zone</a> ( <a href=\"/stan-lee/4040-40467/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\"> Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\"> Jack Kirby</a> shared credit for the creation of the Negative Zone and unstable molecules). The Negative Zone is a parallel universe in which all matter is negatively charged. It also has a breathable atmosphere which allows Mr. Fantastic to lead his team in adventures in the Negative Zone. The Negative Zone is mostly uninhabited and Reed was eventually able to map out most of the area.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108995/2216479-ff_38___a.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2216479\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.119293078056\" data-width=\"679\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 679px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:111.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108995/2216479-ff_38___a.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2216479\"><img alt=\"FF 38 (1965) - Sue is bound next to the Q-bomb\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px\" data-width=\"571\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2216479-ff_38___a.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108995/2216479-ff_38___a.jpg 679w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2216479-ff_38___a.jpg 571w\"><noscript><img alt=\"FF 38 (1965) - Sue is bound next to the Q-bomb\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2216479-ff_38___a.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108995/2216479-ff_38___a.jpg 679w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2216479-ff_38___a.jpg 571w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px\" data-width=\"571\"></noscript></a><figcaption>FF 38 (1965) - Sue is bound next to the Q-bomb</figcaption></figure><p>One of the most important issues of the Silver Age was FF 38, \"Defeated by the Frightful Four\". This is the first issue where the FF are actually defeated by the end of the story. Medusa shows superb cunning by creating a trap for the Invisible Girl. She lures Sue to an East Side fashion house, on the pretext of showing her some wedding dresses. When Sue arrives, Medusa captures her easily with her deadly red hair and the Trapster makes certain the blonde girl cannot escape by shooting her with his paste gun. The Wizard flies himself, Sue and his two partners up into the air. The Frightful Four take an unconscious Invisible Girl to an isolated Pacific island and then go into an underground chamber. Wizard directs Trapster to place the girl down next to the detonation mechanism of a powerful nuclear Q-bomb! The Fantastic Four follow in an attempt to rescue Sue. However, after a brief battle, the Frightful Four escape, leaving the FF on the island. Fortunately Sue's partners find her just in time and Reed gets Sue to use her force field. The bomb explodes. While the FF survive, they have lost their powers. Daredevil then assists them in FF 39-40, as the FF try and avoid death at the hands of Doctor Doom. They do not regain their powers until late in issue 40.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1174781-panel_ffann003b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1174781\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.9225\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:92.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1174781-panel_ffann003b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1174781\"><img alt=\"FF Annual 3 - Sue &amp; Reed are married\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1174781-panel_ffann003b.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1174781-panel_ffann003b.jpg 400w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1174781-panel_ffann003b.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"FF Annual 3 - Sue &amp; Reed are married\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1174781-panel_ffann003b.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1174781-panel_ffann003b.jpg 400w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1174781-panel_ffann003b.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>FF Annual 3 - Sue &amp; Reed are married</figcaption></figure><p>Reed and Sue eventually married in 1965 and it became a celebrity event.

Though still separated from her husband, the Invisible Girl did briefly return for the Annihilus storyline in issues #140 and #141 and a shocking event occurred at the end of #141 which seemed to cement Reed and Sue's separation permanently. Franklin's eyes began to glow and Mr. Fantastic was worried that they were all in grave danger. He picked up a ray gun and fired at his young son, almost hitting his wife in the process by the way. His act succeeded in stopping Franklin's eyes from glowing, but seemed to put the toddler into a coma-like state. Sue blamed Reed for harming Franklin and she walked out for a second time. The Thing declared an end to the Fantastic Four. Reed and Sue finally reconciled at the end of FF #149, but only after Namor staged a fight with Mr. Fantastic. However, Sue did not return to active FF duty for several more issues after the reconciliation. Namor really deserves praise for what he did, as he knew that Sue loved Reed and he put the welfare of the woman he loved above his own feelings for her.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108995/2221330-medusa_repalces_sue.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2221330\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.449591280654\" data-width=\"367\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 367px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:145.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108995/2221330-medusa_repalces_sue.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2221330\"><img alt=\"Medusa - Replacing the Invisible Girl\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 441px) 100vw, 441px\" data-width=\"441\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108995/2221330-medusa_repalces_sue.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108995/2221330-medusa_repalces_sue.jpg 367w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Medusa - Replacing the Invisible Girl\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108995/2221330-medusa_repalces_sue.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108995/2221330-medusa_repalces_sue.jpg 367w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 441px) 100vw, 441px\" data-width=\"441\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Medusa - Replacing the Invisible Girl</figcaption></figure><p>The separation between Sue and Reed lasted for 19 issues. This is really significant, as it means the separation lasted for one year and 7 months. This was a very harsh break-up that could easily have ended in Sue and Reed getting a divorce. The fans seemed to side with Mr. Fantastic in the break-up and against the Invisible Girl. The Fantastic Four Fan Page in issue #152 actually had a shocking letter which urged the writers to kill Sue off and the FF Bullpen implied that a few other fans had also urged them to kill Sue, though not as many as had called for Sue and Reed to divorce. The Fan Page editorial staff went on to say that the consensus was that they had to find a way to make Sue think again, implying that perhaps the gorgeous blonde had not been thinking straight when she left Reed and the team. Medusa did perform in a satisfactory manner in Sue's absence, though she did not demonstrate the awesome power that Crystal did, when Crystal replaced Sue a few years earlier, due to Sue's maternity leave with baby Franklin Richards.</p><p>During the 1970s the Fantastic Four had many artists and writers who would continue the Fantastic Four’s public career as superheroes.

But she would not die. She is transformed into the form of a fetus and transferred into Sue's womb, making Valeria's story true except for one notable difference. She had been Reed's daughter all along. Sue was pregnant again but all would not go well for the Invisible Woman. Due to Sue's cosmic radiation exposure it became difficult to give birth. With Reed away solving a world crisis, Johnny turns to Dr. Doom and asks him to help his sister. Doom was successful in the delivery but forced Sue to allow Doom to name the child. Doom would name her <a href=\"/valeria-richards/4005-2470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2470\"> Valeria Richards</a> after a woman that he had once loved.</p><p>The <a href=\"/mark-waid/4040-40724/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40724\"> Mark Waid</a> era saw the Fantastic Four we see a lot of new concepts and amazing arcs come to light. His first stories on the book dealt with the Fantastic Four as Imaginauts and how they dealt with the fame that they always had their way. We also saw glimpses of Johnny as a much more responsible man, thanks to his sisters conjecture.</p><p>We also witness Doom's ruthlessness in trying cause harm to the Fantastic Four at any costs. He sold his loves life, Valeria (his first love) in an attempt to gain more of the magics that were always in his blood and which he denounced for a life of science. Seeing now that having both would help him in his end, he betrayed her to demons and was able to get the magical knowledge he yearned for.</p><p>To add to that, when Doom delivered baby Valeria, he cast a spell on her that would make her his magical familiar and he used the connection to carry out a devastating attack against the team. In the instant she uttered \"Doom\" demons kidnapped Franklin and Reed and Johnny tried desperately to save him before Johnny was burnt badly by demon fire. Sue and Ben hurry to Reed to tell him what's happened when they discovered Johnny wailing and notice his burnt flesh. They explain what happened and the team sets out to rescue Franklin and heal Valeria from this affliction Doom gave upon her.</p><p>They travel to Latveria where the team is ambushed by Doom. He takes Valeria and uses his magic in order to have the team suffer through painful versions of each others powers. He gives Johnny, Reed's stretching abilities, stretching him to his limits. He gives Sue a painful version of her brother's flame power. He has Ben fight off dozens of monsters. And finally he sticks Reed in a room full of magical information. But with the help of <a href=\"/doctor-strange/4005-1456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\"> Doctor Strange</a>, (or should I say his astral projection), Reed escapes and saves his family. Together they defeat Doom, and rescue Franklin and Valeria. Doom was vanquished and left in Hell by Reed, but not before Doom instilled a parting gift on him and scarred his face. This encounter would have lasting affects on the team and Reed.</p><p> </p><h3>Civil War</h3><p>During the <a href=\"/civil-war/4045-40615/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40615\"> Civil War</a>, the super-hero community was split in two, one in favor of the <a href=\"/super-human-registration-act/4015-40639/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40639\"> Super-Human registration act</a> and the other against it. Reed sided with the Pro-Registration side along with <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\"> Iron Man</a> as team leader against <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\"> Captain America's</a> Anti-Registration team. A group of civilians attacked Johnny and seriously injured him because they blamed the super-heroes for the <a href=\"/stamford-ct/4020-45571/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-45571\"> Stamford</a> Incident. Susan and Thing reluctantly joined Reed's side all the while looking over a hospitalized Johnny, who was seemingly neglected by Reed. Reed, Sue and Ben joined the first battle against Captain America's <a href=\"/secret-avengers/4060-40904/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40904\"> Secret Avengers</a> where a Cyborg <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\"> Thor</a>, made by Iron Man, <a href=\"/hank-pym/4005-2247/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2247\"> Hank Pym</a> and Reed, joined the battle and killed <a href=\"/goliath/4005-3470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3470\"> Goliath</a>. After witnessing this, Sue shielded Cap's team from Thor's attack, giving them the time they needed to teleport away. Although Reed tried to explain himself, Sue refused to hear any of it. She decided to turn her back on Reed, and along with Johnny, who was released from the hospital, she joined the Secret Avengers and left a note for Reed explaining her actions and begging him to spend time with the children, who were neglected by Reed since the start of this struggle. However, Ben refused to participate in this war any longer, and although he did not agree with the Registration Act, he refused to fight the Government so he left for <a href=\"/france/4020-55778/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55778\"> France</a>.

This angers Sue and she smashes Taskmaster down with an invisible construct. Johnny was seen attempting to ambush Iron Man from behind but failed, During the fight, Ben returned and tried to save as many people as possible from being caught in the crossfire. When Captain America decided to surrender, the heroes had to face all the destruction their fight had caused. Sue and Johnny were granted amnesty and they try to reconstruct the streets where the battle took place. In an attempt to reconcile their relationship, Reed is able to convince Sue to come back to him and go on a second honeymoon. He takes Sue to one of the moons of Saturn to try and rekindle their love, as well as give her their first true honeymoon, since they never had one. During their absence, Storm and Black Panther filled in for them along side Ben and Johnny.</p><h3>New Fantastic Four</h3><p>The new team's first mission was to find the body of their friend <a href=\"/gravity/4005-40452/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40452\"> Gravity</a> which was taken by <a href=\"/epoch/4005-6143/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6143\"> Epoch</a> in the story in order to recover him as the Protector of the Universe. However, the Silver Surfer, who has returned to being a Herald of Galactus, was tracking down Epoch, in order to feed her to Galactus, seeing her as an energy source capable of fulfilling his master's hunger. The team traveled to space and confronted the Surfer who, after a brief battle with <a href=\"/black-panther/4005-1477/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1477\"> Black Panther</a>, agreed to help them find their friend but Epoch will be fed to Galactus. Surfer then told Thing that he is a Herald again because he realized that Galactus' is hunger is not related in the story to good or evil.</p><p>However, the recovered Gravity and the Fantastic Four refused to allow Galactus consume Epoch. The Black Panther, using a device similar to the one used by Doctor Doom that takes away the Surfer's Cosmic Powers, fought and defeated the Surfer but they were still no match for Galactus himself. Gravity used all the powers given to him by Epoch to feed Galactus, who restored the Surfer's powers and spared Epoch.</p><h3>Second Honeymoon</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108995/2216464-ff_548___3a.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2216464\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.84470246734398\" data-width=\"689\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 689px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:84.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108995/2216464-ff_548___3a.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2216464\"><img alt=\"FF 548 - Sue is a hostage of the Frightful Four yet again\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2216464-ff_548___3a.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108995/2216464-ff_548___3a.jpg 689w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/108995/2216464-ff_548___3a.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2216464-ff_548___3a.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"FF 548 - Sue is a hostage of the Frightful Four yet again\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2216464-ff_548___3a.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108995/2216464-ff_548___3a.jpg 689w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/108995/2216464-ff_548___3a.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2216464-ff_548___3a.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>FF 548 - Sue is a hostage of the Frightful Four yet again</figcaption></figure><p>In the stories, Reed takes Sue to <a href=\"/titan/4020-41103/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41103\"> Titan</a>, one of the moons of <a href=\"/saturn/4020-56294/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56294\"> Saturn</a>, as a means for them to have a honeymoon, since they never took one when they originally married. While there, Reed discovers a strange object and begins to examine it. Unfortunately he is unsure of it and he teleports back to Earth so other scientists can see and help him determine what it was. In order to do so, however, he left Sue alone on the ship in which they traveled to Titan, where she was ambushed by the <a href=\"/frightful-four/4060-11439/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-11439\"> Frightful Four</a>. Sue fought them off for as long as she could, but she was defeated. The Wizard proved his superb intellect by creating a gun which was set to the frequency of Sue's force field. One shot of the gun and Sue fell to the ground, unconscious. The <a href=\"/wizard/4005-3287/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3287\"> Wizard</a> placed a power dampener on her, making her totally helpless. Sue was held prisoner on her own ship, all in the hopes that Sue, as well as everyone else, recognize the Wizard as Reed's superior. Sue refuses to acknowledge him as her husbands superior, and he attacks her, now that she's subdued. The slap that the Wizard gives Sue is even more brutal than the one Reed delivered to her in FF 281. So much for a second honeymoon, as Sue has become a hostage of the Frightful Four for the third time in Fantastic Four history, the other two being Silver Age FF 38 and FF: The World's Greatest Comic Magazine 9 of 12. Reed, along with Johnny, Ben, Storm, and Black Panther head for the ship to stop the Frightful Four and rescue Sue.</p><p>Sue is subjected to attacks by the Wizard but eventually Reed and the rest of the team manage to return to the ship. Once there, Storm found Sue and released her from the special machine that neutralized Sue's powers. As a means of revenge, Sue threatened the Wizard with creating a force field around his heart. The Wizard, intimidated by the more powerful Sue, subsequently faints and the Frightful Four are then rocketed out into space on a smaller vessel.</p><h3>Brand New Day</h3><p>Before the Civil War, Spider-Man's identity was shared among many super-heroes including the Fantastic Four. On one occasion they in-listed Peter's help in journeying with them to the <a href=\"/macroverse/4020-56470/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56470\"> Macroverse</a> where they helped save a princess from a group of barbarians. During this whole encounter, Peter never wore his mask.</p><p>In present time, The Fantastic Four seek Peter's help again in journeying to the Macroverse, from where Reed received a distress signal. At first Spidey refuses to go but then accepts after Reed produces him a check to pay his bills. However, after <a href=\"/one-more-day/4045-49939/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-49939\"> One More Day</a>, the Fantastic Four have also forget of Spidey's identity, making the Human Torch, who was once a very close friend to both Peter and Spider-Man, very skeptical. When they arrive at the Macroverse, they discover five statues of themselves, the inhabitants of the Macroverse idolize them for their previous adventure. Once the Johnny realizes that the unmasked Spider-Man's statue's face is unrecognizable, he recalls that he once knew more about Spider-Man and wants to know what he did that caused them to forget who he is. When Spidey refuses to answer and declares that he won't go down that road again and that no one will ever know his secret, an angered Human Torch burns off Spidey's mask but Susan uses her powers to protect Peter's face and lashes out at Johnny for betraying Spidey's trust. However, they are in a war-zone between two races, and the combined might of Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four was able to return the Macroverse to peace. When they were heading back to Earth, Reed asks Spidey about his secret identity and how he was able to have everyone forget it. Spidey tells him that it was the result of a special spell that prevents anyone from knowing Peter's identity unless Peter himself unmasks. Johnny urges Peter to unmask since they're all friends but Peter still refuses until Reed tells him that he has a \"psychic firewall\" that allowing them to know his identity and keep it to themselves. Peter agrees and unmasks and they renew their friendship.</p><h3>Planet Hulk &amp; World War Hulk</h3><p>The Hulk, who is now under the control of Banner, was sent to <a href=\"/las-vegas/4020-55734/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55734\"> Las Vegas</a> by the Fantastic Four to investigate a Hydra <a href=\"/gamma-bomb/4055-55673/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55673\"> Gamma Bomb</a>. However, things went horribly wrong and the bomb detonated in his face so Human Torch and the Thing are sent to bring back the Hulk before more people get hurt. But Bruce doesn't seem to be in control any more, as the Hulk now appears as a bald Grey Hulk. As Ben and Johnny fight this mindless Hulk, he seems to be recalling some of the tragic events in his life. Ben realizes that some-thing's wrong with him and that the explosion somehow messed up his mind. Ben told Johnny that he and the Hulk were both hit by something that made them monsters people need but don't want and that \"monsters understand monsters\". He attempts to reason with the Hulk despite Torch's protests. However, this doesn't work and Hulk recalls Betty's death and hallucinates that Thing is the <a href=\"/abomination/4005-3489/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3489\"> Abomination</a> (who killed <a href=\"/betty-ross/4005-3445/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3445\"> Betty</a>) and savagely attacks the Thing who doesn't fight back. Hulk hits Thing so hard, Ben is immobilized and tastes blood and before Hulk could finish Thing off, Human Torch goes nova but it didn't seem to have any effect on him until the Hulk told them not to worry about him and that he's fine.</p><p>The fight in Las Vegas caused a lot of destruction so, the Illuminati were debating on whether or not Hulk should remain on Earth. Reed, Iron Man, <a href=\"/black-bolt/4005-4329/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4329\"> Black Bolt</a>, and Doctor Strange were all for sending Hulk into outer space, so he wouldn't harm anyone ever again. However, their plan didn't work out as they planned, as the Hulk, now stronger than ever, returned to Earth and declared war on the Illuminati, including Reed. When the Hulk came for Reed, with the help of Susan and the New Fantastic Four, he projected a hologram of the <a href=\"/sentry/4005-1454/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1454\"> Sentry</a> in order to calm the Hulk down, but his plan backfired and the Hulk defeated the Fantastic Four and captured him. The Hulk had built a gladiatorial arena in <a href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\"> New York</a> and equipped Reed and Tony with obedience disks, forcing them to fight each other to the death. Reed defeated Tony but Hulk spared because he came for justice, not murder. During the final battle between Sentry and the Hulk, Stark used a satellite cannon to finally defeat the Hulk.</p><h3>Secret Invasion</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108995/2220918-ff___secret_invasion_3bbe.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2220918\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4446640316206\" data-width=\"506\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 506px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:144.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108995/2220918-ff___secret_invasion_3bbe.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2220918\"><img alt=\"Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four 1\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px\" data-width=\"443\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2220918-ff___secret_invasion_3bbe.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108995/2220918-ff___secret_invasion_3bbe.jpg 506w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2220918-ff___secret_invasion_3bbe.jpg 443w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four 1\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2220918-ff___secret_invasion_3bbe.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108995/2220918-ff___secret_invasion_3bbe.jpg 506w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2220918-ff___secret_invasion_3bbe.jpg 443w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px\" data-width=\"443\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four 1</figcaption></figure><p>The <a href=\"/illuminati/4060-40421/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40421\"> Illuminati</a> investigated the corpse of <a href=\"/elektra/4005-1802/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1802\"> Elektra</a> who turned out to be a Skrull when Black Bolt revealed himself to be a Skrull himself and attacked the other members only to be killed by <a href=\"/namor/4005-1476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\"> Namor</a>. The Illuminati then separated since anyone of them could be a Skrull. Reed and Hank Pym were examining the body of the Skrull in order to find out why the Skrulls are undetectable. When Reed discovered why, Hank revealed himself to be a Skrull and shot Reed with a special gun, destabilizing him.</p><p>He was taken to a Skrull armada in orbit where he was tortured by the Skrulls until being save by <a href=\"/sword/4060-41666/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41666\"> SWORD</a> agent <a href=\"/abigail-brand/4005-4441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4441\"> Abigail Brand</a>.

Brand and Richards both traveled to the <a href=\"/savage-land/4020-21766/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-21766\"> Savage Land</a> where they used this weapon to identify the Skrulls during their battle with the <a href=\"/new-avengers/4060-42520/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42520\"> New</a> and <a href=\"/mighty-avengers/4060-46148/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-46148\"> Mighty Avengers</a>.</p><p>Susan was on a speaking tour around the world when she was attacked in her hotel room by Skrull Reed who used a forcefield to knock her out and neutralize her. That same Skrull took the form of Susan in order to infiltrate the Baxter Building while Ben, Johnny, Franklin and Valeria were there, and opened a portal to the Negative Zone causing half the building along with everyone in it, the Skrull Susan, Ben, Johnny, Franklin and Valeria, to be sucked in. While in the Negative Zone, they were attacked by Bug-like monsters. While Ben protected the kids from the \"bugs\", Johnny and Sue made it back to Reed's lab where they debated on who she really was. He asked her what her favorite movie was to which she answered wrong. The Skrull revealed herself to be Lyja, Johnny's ex. They fight and Lyja is captured by a Negative Zone monster but Torch saves her and they kiss for old times' sake. Franklin and Valeria make their way back to the lab to get a machine their dad built for them for defensive purposes and they help Thing fight off the rest of the bugs. Franklin suggests that they should free the <a href=\"/tinkerer/4005-3144/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3144\"> Tinkerer</a> from his N-Zone prison in order to help them fix the Baxter Building. While on their way to the prison on the <a href=\"/fantasti-car-mk-i/4055-42331/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-42331\"> Fantasticar</a>, Valeria falls off, only to be saved by Lyja, who reveals that she was sent to kill them all but because of her feelings for Johnny she sent them to the N-Zone instead. The Thing frees the Tinkerer, and after an agreement, he manages to return the building to normal. As they make their way back to a ruined New York, Lyja decides to stay behind.</p><p>Sue was revealed to be held captive on another Skrull ship along with other heroes and villains, who were freed and returned back to Earth when Iron Man destroyed the Skrull ship. After returning to Earth, she reunited with Reed and they both checked on their family before joining the final battle along side their fellow heroes against the Skrulls.</p><h3>Dark Reign</h3><p>When the Fantastic Four were attacked by <a href=\"/hammer/4060-56065/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56065\"> HAMMER</a> agents, Reed built a device called the <a href=\"/the-bridge/4055-56497/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56497\"> Bridge</a> which allowed him in the story to explore alternate dimensions. The team was sent to other continuities, leaving Franklin and Valeria under siege from <a href=\"/norman-osborn/4005-58812/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\"> Norman Osborn</a>, HAMMER agents and <a href=\"/venom/4005-1486/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\"> Venom</a>. Valeria was able to outsmart them and separate Osborn from his agents and led in a room where he was confronted by Franklin wearing a Spider-Man mask, calling him a villain. While Osborn is chasing the children holding a gun, the Fantastic Four make their way back to the Baxter Building where an enraged Invisible Woman scream at Osborn to stay away from her children. However, the insane Osborn challenges her to make him, which she does by knocking him down with a forcefield and preventing his remaining forces from reaching him. Reed tells Osborn to leave and never return but he replies by attempting to shoot Reed, only to be shot by Franklin. However, Franklin was holding a harmless toy gun, having Ben and Johnny thinking that Franklin's powers may have returned. Sue then told Reed to destroy the Bridge which he did but secretly he put it back together.</p><h3>Prime Elements; the end of a Family</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108995/2221100-ff_574___franklin_s_birthday_party.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2221100\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.58\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:58.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108995/2221100-ff_574___franklin_s_birthday_party.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2221100\"><img alt=\"Fantastic Four 574 - Franklin's birthday party\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2221100-ff_574___franklin_s_birthday_party.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108995/2221100-ff_574___franklin_s_birthday_party.jpg 600w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/108995/2221100-ff_574___franklin_s_birthday_party.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2221100-ff_574___franklin_s_birthday_party.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Fantastic Four 574 - Franklin's birthday party\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2221100-ff_574___franklin_s_birthday_party.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108995/2221100-ff_574___franklin_s_birthday_party.jpg 600w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/108995/2221100-ff_574___franklin_s_birthday_party.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/108995/2221100-ff_574___franklin_s_birthday_party.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Fantastic Four 574 - Franklin's birthday party</figcaption></figure><p>On Franklin's birthday, an older Franklin infiltrated the Baxter Building and used a forcefield to prevent the team from reaching him. He then confronted Franklin and seemingly knock him down, angering the team. He then entered Valeria's room and informed her about the coming conflict between four cities and that the only hope is Doom. He urged her not to tell anyone of this encounter before she recognized him as her brother. When Reed was finally able to penetrate the forcefield, Future Franklin teleported away.

In them, they have something equivalent to a computer. It forms a network, keeping the team up to date. It also displays data for them and touchpad controls are available on their gauntlets. The costume is like a GPS, providing their location. It has a scanner which can scan things in their environment, being able to scan things like how many people are in the room next to them.</p><h3>Members</h3><ul><li>Spider-Man- once tried to \"apply\" to the team but reconsidered when he wasn't gonna get paid.</li><li>Hulk -in the Grey Hulk and the Professor personality in different occasions.</li><li>Wolverine</li><li>Ghost Rider -Danny Ketch version.</li></ul><p>When a female Skrull captured the original team, she impersonated the Invisible Woman to recruit a new team to avenge the \"death\" of the original and to steal a weapon from the Mole Man.</p><p>The team reassembled again by Doctor Strange to arrest the Human Torch for his actions that destroyed a quarter of a city.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14751/486710-250px_ultimate_fantastic_four.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-486710\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14751/486710-250px_ultimate_fantastic_four.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-486710\"><img alt=\"The Fantastic Four of Earth-1610\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14751/486710-250px_ultimate_fantastic_four.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14751/486710-250px_ultimate_fantastic_four.jpg 250w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Fantastic Four of Earth-1610\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14751/486710-250px_ultimate_fantastic_four.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14751/486710-250px_ultimate_fantastic_four.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Fantastic Four of Earth-1610</figcaption></figure><p><b>Earth-1610</b></p><p>The Fantastic Four of the Ultimate universe is composed younger versions of the original four, <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\"> Mr. Fantastic</a>, <a href=\"/invisible-woman/4005-2190/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2190\"> Invisible Woman</a>, <a href=\"/human-torch/4005-2120/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2120\"> Human Torch</a> and <a href=\"/thing/4005-2114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2114\"> Thing</a>.

While on the N-Zone, N-ihil pretended to be the Four's friend and explained how realities are stacked on the universe. That's when they became enemies. They returned home along with some sort of dinosaur leaving Annihilus in the N-Zone. Then they faced an old think tank jealous Brainiac going by the name The Thinker. She took over the Baxter Building and started going up against Reed. Brain against brain. The better genius won and the <a href=\"/mad-thinker/4005-2131/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2131\"> Thinker</a>, Rhona Burchill, escaped. Johnny went to school with <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\"> Peter Parker</a> (AKA Spider-man). Johnny fell for a girl named <a href=\"/liz-allen/4005-15408/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15408\"> Liz Allen</a>. <a href=\"/mary-jane/4005-13380/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13380\"> MJ</a>, Peter, <a href=\"/kong/4005-12490/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12490\"> Kong</a>, Liz and Johnny went to the beach together. There he was seen using his powers. Liz being mutant-phobic stopped talking to him so Peter as Spidey went and cheered him up. Reed made contact with himself and the rest of the FF from another universe making them become the Ultimate Frightful Four.</p><p>Reed trying to cure Ben decided to change time. As a result <a href=\"/skrulls/4060-40668/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40668\"> Skrulls</a> went to earth and gave them pills to give them superpowers. In the end they were betrayed by them all and they all died for the exception for Ben Grimm who didn't take the pill. He fought the Super-Skrull that used a suit to copy their powers. With no powers to be able to copy Ben took over and went back in time to stop the stopping of the accident. Again they faced the Frightful Four zombies and Doom went down along with them trying to be a hero. Spider-Man had a clone crisis and went to the FF for help. One of the clones who thought was Peter's father asked Sue to be his friend before dying. Reed cured <a href=\"/mary-jane/4005-13380/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13380\"> MJ</a> from a monster transformation she was having because of the clones. Then they gave the <a href=\"/scorpion/4005-4484/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4484\"> Scorpion</a> clone to <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\"> SHIELD</a>. <a href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\"> Ga Lak Tus</a> was going to destroy the world and the FF did their part in stopping him. Teaming up with Ultimate <a href=\"/captain-marvel/4005-1472/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1472\"> Captain Marvel</a> and the <a href=\"/ultimates/4060-40504/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40504\"> Ultimates</a> they got information from the Kree.</p><p>Reed created a machine that would damage Ga Lak Tus with the help of the Ultimate <a href=\"/vision/4005-1504/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1504\"> Vision</a>. The Fantastic Four then went up against <a href=\"/gallowglass/4005-51527/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51527\"> Gallowglass</a> and <a href=\"/ronan/4005-4818/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4818\"> Ronan</a>. They also faced their father <a href=\"/thanos/4005-7607/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\"> Thanos</a> and got out of the problem with the help of Seed. The Thinker came back stealing <a href=\"/cerebro/4055-15073/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-15073\"> Cerebro's</a> hard drive and making the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\"> X-Men</a> believe that it was the FF's fault. In the end they teamed up to defeat her. Then they faced Diablo a guy who created a teleportation from past to present and relied on magic.</p><p>After the Fantastic Four first encountered Thanos in his home dimension, Thanos implanted the idea for the <a href=\"/cosmic-cube/4055-40949/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40949\"> Cosmic Cube</a> in Reed Richard's mind. Legend told that Thanos had discovered the original Cosmic Cube after it feel from the sky above his planet. With it he would attempt to control all existence. Thanos' defeat was narrow, and the costs were great. While Reed believed that he was creating the cosmic cube out of his own accord, Thanos was controlling Reed in order to re-create the powerful weapon that he once lost. As Reed continued to analyze the possibilities contained within the energy lattice, he found the draw of creating a cube irresistible. Reed's first attempt to harness the energy required for fueling the cube would result in the Fantastic Four's first encounter with the real Silver Surfer as well as the inter-dimensional being that they would com to know as the <a href=\"/psycho-man/4005-7112/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7112\"> Psycho-Man</a>.</p><p>Sue then had to face <a href=\"/red-ghost/4005-2473/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2473\"> Red Ghost</a>. After the Red Ghost's defeat Reed would continue to work on developing the Cube. She went by herself to what she thought was a conference but was caught with the woman who became the Ultimate <a href=\"/red-ghost/4005-2473/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2473\"> Red Ghost</a>. With the help of the Ultimate <a href=\"/crimson-dynamo/4005-7234/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7234\"> Crimson Dynamo</a> the rest of the FF saved Sue. Because of the actions of Reed while building the cube their relationship was broken off. When he finished the cube it automatically protected <a href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\"> New York</a> from an attack from Seed. Thanos' forces would spring foreword, removing a block of <a href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\"> New York City</a> containing the Four to take back to his home dimension. Thanos battled Reed in order to take the cube by force. While the Cube was a powerful weapon, Reed's inexperience wielding it made him susceptible to Thanos' power, and Reed was seemingly destroyed before Thanos acquired the cube. Using the power of the cube, Thanos came into our reality and took over the minds and wills of Earth's superheroes including the Ultimates, the X-Men, the remaining members of the Fantastic Four, and all solo heroes. These heroes in turn helped Thanos capture any remaining rebels. Thanos was disturbed because he could tell that he somehow didn't have full access to the Cube's vast powers as he once did.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/504374-mr._fantastic_thanos_nic_klein51.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-504374\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.42\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:142.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/504374-mr._fantastic_thanos_nic_klein51.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-504374\"><img alt=\"War over the Cosmic Cube\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-width=\"450\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/77/504374-mr._fantastic_thanos_nic_klein51.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/504374-mr._fantastic_thanos_nic_klein51.jpg 800w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/77/504374-mr._fantastic_thanos_nic_klein51.jpg 676w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/77/504374-mr._fantastic_thanos_nic_klein51.jpg 450w\"><noscript><img alt=\"War over the Cosmic Cube\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/77/504374-mr._fantastic_thanos_nic_klein51.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/504374-mr._fantastic_thanos_nic_klein51.jpg 800w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/77/504374-mr._fantastic_thanos_nic_klein51.jpg 676w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/77/504374-mr._fantastic_thanos_nic_klein51.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-width=\"450\"></noscript></a><figcaption>War over the Cosmic Cube</figcaption></figure><p>Meanwhile, Ben Grimm had located Thanos' estranged daughter <a href=\"/atrea/4005-53792/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53792\"> Atrea</a> who helped him realize that Reed was not actually dead. During his battle with Thanos Reed used the power of the Cosmic Cube to create a charred likeness of himself, while turning his actual form into an energy being. This move allowed him to escape Thanos' full power by being perceived as dead. Atrea felt Reed was still alive but trapped, and freed his essence.</p><p>Convincing Atrea to rebel against her father, the three traveled back to their home dimension to battle Thanos. In the middle of the warped landscape of New York they found his citadel. With Atrea and Ben acting as a diversion Reed was able to get to Thanos to battle for control of the Cosmic Cube. While in partial control of the Cosmic Cube, Reed knew he was no match for Thanos' power.</p><p>The small portion of the Cube's power which Thanos previously was denied access to was Reed's work. Reed unlocked this sequestered power within the Cube, giving Thanos full access to the Cube's infinite resources. With full access to the Cosmic Cube restored, Thanos' physical form quickly deteriorated as he died. Thanos' infatuation with death had created a subconscious drive within himself, and it was that desire for the fullness of death that destroyed Thanos.</p><p>This left Reed the question of what to do with the Cube. It's vast powers had proven to dangerous for anyone, even himself, to wield. In order to deal with the Cube Reed opened up a very small rift in space and time and dropped the cube through. The cube plummeted through the rift and landed on Thanos' home planet many years earlier. The cube found its way to the sand in front of Thanos' very feet. The resulting paradox was that the original Cosmic Cube, the cube that Thanos had tricked Reed into building for him, was actually the Cosmic Cube that Reed had designed and built.</p><p>After the Cosmic Cube event Sue went up with a new mystery. An giant egg was found along with the ex-Think Tank people now living underground. The the Ultimate <a href=\"/salems-seven/4060-41219/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41219\"> Salem's Seven</a> appeared into the picture trying to stop a flaming building and getting all the glory.</p><p><strong>March on Ultimatum</strong></p><p>20 Years into the future a new X-Men team that consisted of Captain America, Wolverine, <a href=\"/kitty-pryde/4005-3548/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3548\"> Shadowcat</a>, <a href=\"/rogue/4005-1446/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1446\"> Rogue</a> and a male Phoenix wanted to prevent the events of <a href=\"/ultimatum/4045-55745/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55745\"> Ultimatum</a> so they traveled back in time to stop it.</p><p>Reed and Sue were going to go on a date when the future X-Men arrived trying to kill Reed. Reed not having any internal organs couldn't be killed so they kidnapped him. The rest of the Fantastic Four went to the present X-Men for help. Reed discovered that the future male Phoenix was actually his son Franklin Richards.</p><p>The then future Wolverine attempted to kill Phoenix. Then the rest of the future X-Men discovered that future Wolverine was actually a <a href=\"/sentinels/4060-4296/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-4296\"> Sentinel</a> from the future. By the time the FF and present X-Men got there many Wolverines and Sentinels had been destroyed had killed Rouge and had taken Reed into the future.

He told the group that himself, Jean and the original Cap had been stripped away of their powers so he took over a s Captain America after Steve Rogers aged 100 years, then he died. In the future <a href=\"/iceman/4005-1464/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1464\"> Iceman</a> was captured by the Sentinels and Reed escaped his cell when he followed a trail of fire. Thinking it to be Johnny he then saw the future Fantastic Four: Invisible Woman, Iron Thing, Namor and <a href=\"/firestar/4005-2101/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2101\"> Firestar</a>.</p><p>The future X-Men, or what was left of them told the present X-Men and FF that the reason that they needed to stop it all was because the new ruler was getting rid of mutants. That new ruler was Sue. Future Sue convinced present Reed to fix a machine that would strip away people of their powers just like Cyclops´s Reed gave to her request while the present X-Men, present FF, and future X-men went into the future to find out what was going on. Ben and Firestar found out that both of them in the future were in love and Iceman found himself being killed by Namor. Sue met <a href=\"/annihilus/4005-10964/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10964\"> Nihil</a> again then just to find out that he was actually future Reed. Future Phoenix turned everyone in to his mother. Reed then took away future Sue´s powers since clearly she had gone crazy because of her brother´s death. Everyone let the future hero´s free from a prison in the N-Zone Sue had made to maintain the super powered heroes. The present FF and X-men went back to their own time and Sue and Reed left to be alone. Sue told Reed she was worried that would eventually happen to them, but Reed assured that it would not. Sue left and then from a drawer Reed took out a ring, sure that future would not happen.</p><h3>Ultimatum</h3><p>It's Tuesday 4:12 PM. Reed Richards is about to propose to Sue. Ben Grim is working out with <a href=\"/herbie/4005-23720/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23720\"> H.E.R.B.I.E</a> watching over. Johnny Storm and his father are having a heated argument on Johnny's intelligence.</p><p>It's Tuesday 4:13 PM. New York is underwater.</p><p>At the Baxter Building, Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Girl reach the roof top. A whale enters the room with the Thing, Johnny and Franklin Storm are underwater. At their rooftop of the Baxter, Sue uses all her power to keep the water away from New York and then she collapses. The Thing arrives and Reed leaves Sue with him.</p><p>At 4:21 PM, Reed is already on an FF submarine and meets with Namor. Reed accuses him of the event while Namor excuses himself saying it was not him.</p><p>It's 12:31 AM in Latveria and all except Dr. Doom are frozen solid.</p><p>Then, telepathically Xavier tells all superheroes, that he knows who is responsible for this events, and that all of them have to unite against this threat, to stop <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\"> Magneto</a>.</p><p>Back in the Baxter, Ben takes over and is now alone. The Baxter Building is turning invisible and Sue isn't stable. No scientist knows how to help her, and the one scientist who might have a chance of saving her is dead, Franklin Storm is dead.</p><p>The Thing has gone out of resources and Sue´s mother then arrives. She suggest that the person who could help would be Dr. Molveick a.k.a. The Mole Man. With the help of the students from Baxter B help Ben find Mole Man and save him from fire mole men. As a result he helps the Thing figures out that the way to help Sue is to internally help her. Using <a href=\"/pym-particles/4015-42077/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-42077\"> Pym particles</a> the Thing and the Mole man are going to go inside the Invisible Girl.</p><p>The Thing and the Mole Man Successfully rescue Sue from herself by going inside. Inside they fix the problem and then after that Sue recovers completely. During the journey inside Sue Ben and Dr. Molevick found some strange antibodies that attacked them. Sue explained that these weren't antibodies, they were actually some form of robotic organisms implanted inside her by Reed without any of the Fantastic Four's knowledge. Because of this Sue realized that with he GPS system imbedded in them she could locate Johnny. So she gets to work. This storyline is most reminiscent of the 1966 Sci-Fi classic entitled Fantastic Voyage. That film shrunk a submarine and sent of team inside of an important diplomat to save his life.</p><p>Sue realizes that they need a huge antenna to locate Reed and Johnny around the world, so Sue's mother explains how advanced Atlantean technology could become useful here. Sue, Dr. Molevick, Mrs. Richards and Ben head into deep waters to get this technology. On their dive they discover some other Atlantean fugitives that were locked up. After being captured, since they couldn't surpass the power of these people, Sue's mother makes a deal that gets them out of the mess. They leave from Atlantis and create the necessary equipment to locate the nanobots implanted in Johnny and Reed. A mapping system appears showing the location of the rest of the team but it shows they aren't necessarily on earth. On a different earth Reed is with Dr. Doom and <a href=\"/power-princess/4005-6912/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6912\"> Princess Zarda</a> while Johnny is in a dimension where <a href=\"/dormammu/4005-2205/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2205\"> Dormammu</a>, a demon lord, rules.</p><p>Hulk and Spider-Man see Doctor Strange's <a href=\"/sanctum-sanctorum/4020-55966/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55966\"> Sanctum Sanctorum</a> blowing up. Magical beings start bursting out of control and Hulk and Spidey try and stop it. Dormammu, powered by the Human Torch, appears and kills everything in his path, apparently including Spider-Man.</p><p>Doctor Strange tries fighting off this monster but fails and get's killed in the process.</p><p>Now that Sue and Ben have located Johnny they go in to get him back. The Invisible Woman uses a forcefield over Dormammu's head cutting the oxygen from the monster and Johnny gives it all it's got to cut his breathing off. The effect brings him to turn back into a little man re-unites the Storms and 3/4 of the FF.</p><p>Reed finally comes back with <a href=\"/nick-fury/4005-3202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3202\"> Nick Fury</a> and he along Doctor Doom and Princess Zardra take the fight to Magneto. The X-Men take the battle to Magneto and what's left of his <a href=\"/brotherhood-of-evil-mutants/4060-17652/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-17652\"> brotherhood</a>. Nick Fury, with the help of Jean, shows Magneto how mutants are just a man-made accident. After this Cyclops kills Magneto.</p><h3>Post-Ultimatum</h3><p>After the events of <a href=\"/ultimatum/4045-55745/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55745\"> Ultimatum</a>, Sue and Reed break up and the Fantastic Four are officially disbanded. Reed goes back to his parent's house, Sue takes over the Baxter Building for herself, burying herself in work, Ben joins the military and Johnny starts to travel.</p><p>After some time Johnny got tired of traveling around so instead of going to the Baxter he arrived on Peter Parker's doorstep. After talking to his sister he decides to live with the Parkers, Iceman and <a href=\"/gwen-stacy/4005-1480/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1480\"> Gwen Stacy</a> all while going to high school.</p><h3>Ultimate Enemy</h3><p>Reed Richards, now ex-leader of the world famous Fantastic Four, now lives with his parents and his father is not happy about that especially since he has no job to contribute to the family. After being brutally woken up by his father, Reed's computer detects an energy flux, and then somebody knocks at the door, even though Reed warns his father not to open the door, he opens it, and a purple, cloud-like explosion happens inside the Richard's home.</p><p>Sue uses her invisible powers to hide herself from the rest of the world while taking a walk in the city. She feels better when not having to be a world spectacle to the rest of the world. Once back in the Baxter she wonders all alone the place only to find Ben Grim interrupts her loneliness. After a brief catching up between the two, Sue examines Ben's recent shedding of rocks and Ben drops a bomb on her by telling her that he loves her. Now that her relationship with Reed is over he took the opportunity to tell her that. One of the Thing's rocks falls and leaves Sue by saying: \"something to remember me by\". Then a huge, purple, cloud/octopus-like creatures overtakes the Baxter building and Ben even when trying to stop it he is thrown to a street.</p><p><b>Earth-2149</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14751/486717-ultimate_fantastic_four_30.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-486717\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5036363636364\" data-width=\"550\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 550px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14751/486717-ultimate_fantastic_four_30.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-486717\"><img alt=\"The Zombie Four of Earth-2149\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px\" data-width=\"425\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14751/486717-ultimate_fantastic_four_30.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14751/486717-ultimate_fantastic_four_30.jpg 550w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14751/486717-ultimate_fantastic_four_30.jpg 425w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Zombie Four of Earth-2149\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14751/486717-ultimate_fantastic_four_30.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14751/486717-ultimate_fantastic_four_30.jpg 550w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14751/486717-ultimate_fantastic_four_30.jpg 425w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px\" data-width=\"425\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Zombie Four of Earth-2149</figcaption></figure><p>*In the Zombie Universe the Fantastic Four as most other heroes are transformed into zombies.

The film depicted the origin of the Fantastic Four and their first battles with Dr. Doom and Mole Man.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14751/486675-picfffirstmovie.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-486675\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.55833333333333\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14751/486675-picfffirstmovie.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-486675\"><img alt=\"The Fantastic Four (1994)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14751/486675-picfffirstmovie.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14751/486675-picfffirstmovie.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14751/486675-picfffirstmovie.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Fantastic Four (1994)\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14751/486675-picfffirstmovie.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14751/486675-picfffirstmovie.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14751/486675-picfffirstmovie.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Fantastic Four (1994)</figcaption></figure><p>In 1994, a film about the Fantastic Four was produced in order that the studio, Constantin Film, could secure the rights to the group. Unknown to the director, crew and actors of the film, this movie was never intended to be released. The film starts with Reed and Victor Von Doom in college. An experiment goes goes wrong and Victor is allegedly killed. Reed's friend introduces him to her children Sue (a teenager) and Johnny (a preteen). Reed grieves for his friend but finishes school and years starts a space expedition (one that is to be piloted by his roommate Ben Grim) and they decide to bring, a now older, Sue and Johnny along (for shits and giggles).</p><p>Little do they know that Victor Von Doom did not die the day of that horrible experiment, and to that day had been planning his revenge on the man he assumes is responsible for his experiment not working (none other than Reed Richards of course). He sabotages their ship so it flies right on course with some cosmic rays (an energy source that has unknown strength) the ship seems to be destroyed in space. Doom laughs a terrible laugh and marvels in his years of planning coming to fruition.</p><p>The group survives the cosmic ray exposure and they crash land back on earth even though their ship blew up and it shouldn't be possible. Once they find they are all alive, they also discover they all have amazing powers. Reed Richards is elastic, Sue can hide from sight, Johnny is the Human Torch, and Ben has become the Thing, with a large gravel-like exoskeleton and super strength.</p><p>All you need to know is that Doom finds out the Fantastic Four are still alive and lures them to his lair. They fight. Doom's device almost goes off. They stop it and save the day. The End.</p><p><a href=\"/fantastic-four/4025-40/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-40\"><b><br />Fantastic Four</b></a></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29744/577485-f4_040.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-577485\" data-ratio=\"0.6665\" data-width=\"2000\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 2000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29744/577485-f4_040.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-577485\"><img alt=\"The team in the Tim Story films\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/29744/577485-f4_040.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29744/577485-f4_040.jpg 2000w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/2/29744/577485-f4_040.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/29744/577485-f4_040.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The team in the Tim Story films\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/29744/577485-f4_040.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29744/577485-f4_040.jpg 2000w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/2/29744/577485-f4_040.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/29744/577485-f4_040.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The team in the Tim Story films</figcaption></figure><p>Released in the US on July 8, 2005 it was the third superhero film of the year ( <a href=\"/elektra/4025-126/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-126\"> Elektra</a> and <a href=\"/batman-begins/4025-12/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-12\"> Batman Begins</a> being the first and second respectively). The film was directed by Tim Story and released by 20th Century Fox, and though it was the first Fantastic Four film to be released it was the second to be filmed. This film told of the forming of the Fantastic Four and how they got their abilities. It was also a tale of their change in mindset when they slowly began to accept that it was their duty to be heroes, they were not destined to be normal, even Ben came to terms with this. The film also depicted the origins of the team's nemesis Dr. Doom and showed the characters developing their powers, pushing them to their limits and learning how they work. In the end, when working as a team they find themselves able to defeat Dr. Doom, his \"dead\" body is then shipped off to Latveria.</p><p>Among the deleted scenes included on the December 2005 DVD release:</p><ul><li>Three slightly modified scenes concerning the attack on Doctor Doom - one in which Reed uses his body as a funnel to direct a stream of water at Doom, one in which he doesn't, and one in which Doctor Doom's line \"Is that the best you can do, a little heat?\" is cut short, having the \"..a little heat?\" portion removed.</li></ul><ul><li>Two versions of a scene with Jessica Alba and Ioan Gruffudd. The original features the pair in the planetarium, where they communicate their feelings for each other without an argumentative tone. This ends in a kiss. The second version, included in the DVD release as a bonus feature, features the two outside, looking toward the <a href=\"/wiki/Statue_Of_Liberty/\" data-ref-id=\"Statue_Of_Liberty\"> Statue Of Liberty</a>. Similar lines are used, but it ends with Alba's Susan turning invisible before Gruffudd's Reed can kiss her. A joke was used during the line \"a stronger man\": Instead of Reed giving himself a square jaw (as he does in the theatrical release), he makes his skin look like the <a href=\"/wiki/X-Men/\" data-ref-id=\"X-Men\"> X-Men's</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Wolverine_%28comics%29/\" data-ref-id=\"Wolverine_%28comics%29\"> Wolverine</a>. Actor Gruffudd breaks the <a href=\"/wiki/Fourth_wall/\" data-ref-id=\"Fourth_wall\"> fourth wall</a> and looks directly at the camera as he does this.</li></ul><ul><li>There is also a scene where Reed and Sue are in a storage room of the Baxter Building where we see on one of the shelves is a robot that is supposed to be H.E.R.B.I.E. from the 1970s Fantastic Four cartoon.</li></ul><p>The novelization of the film contained a number of scenes not in the final cut, including a small number of scenes that developed the character of Alicia Masters.</p><h4><a href=\"/fantastic-four-rise-of-the-silver-surfer/4025-41/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-41\">Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer</a></h4><p>A sequel to the Fantastic Four film of 2005, this film was also directed by Tim Story. Rated PG-13, this film was released in North America on June 15, 2007 and some of its stars include:</p><ul><li>Ioan Gruffudd (Mr. Fantastic)</li><li>Jessica Alba (Invisible Woman)</li><li>Chris Evans (Human Torch)</li><li>Michael Chiklis (Thing)</li><li>Julian McMahon (Doctor Doom)</li><li>Kerry Washington (Alicia Masters)</li><li>Beau Garrett ( <a href=\"/frankie-raye/4005-11605/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11605\"> Frankie Raye</a>)</li><li>Doug Jones (Silver Surfer)</li><li>Laurence Fishburne (Surfer's Voice)</li><li>Stan Lee (Stan Lee)</li></ul><p>This film starts off quite some time after the last movie ended and focuses on the upcoming marriage between Sue and Reed and their relationship/future as well as the threat the Silver Surfer poses to the world. Once again the team finds themselves needing to work together as the Earth will be devoured if they do not, forcing them to do things like working with the resurrected Doom. Eventually they try and capture the Surfer but when they succeed they realize it was the wrong thing to do and Sue frees the alien, after creating a bond with him. She learns a lot about him and eventually it is this relationship that causes him to help the Fantastic Four by driving away Galactus, turning against his master.</p><h4><a href=\"/the-fantastic-four/4025-1950/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-1950\">The Fantastic Four</a> (2015)</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4467081-5375152002-sHgeC.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4467081\" data-ratio=\"1.4824707846411\" data-width=\"599\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 599px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:148.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4467081-5375152002-sHgeC.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4467081\"><img alt=\"The new FF\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4467081-5375152002-sHgeC.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4467081-5375152002-sHgeC.jpg 599w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4467081-5375152002-sHgeC.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The new FF\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4467081-5375152002-sHgeC.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4467081-5375152002-sHgeC.jpg 599w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4467081-5375152002-sHgeC.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The new FF</figcaption></figure><p>After the disappointing reviews and box office returns for Rise of the Silver Surfer, the franchise was put on hiatus for a number years until a new film was greenlit for a 2015 release.

Hearing of the Hulk’s rampage, <a href=\"/rick-jones/4005-2248/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2248\">Rick Jones</a> sent a radio message to <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">The Fantastic Four</a> informing them of the problem, seeking to enlist their aid in stopping the Hulk. In a twist of fate, <a href=\"/loki/4005-4324/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4324\">Loki</a> diverted the message to Thor, whom he hoped would then battle the Hulk. Unbeknownst to Loki, and unintended, too, the message was also picked up by <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man</a>, <a href=\"/hank-pym/4005-2247/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2247\">Ant-Man</a> and <a href=\"/wasp/4005-1502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1502\">The Wasp</a>. These heroes, as well as Thor, all responded to the call and came together to stop the menace of The Hulk. Upon engaging the Hulk, they soon discovered Loki’s trickery and teamed up with Hulk to defeat the God of Mischief. Ant-Man mentioned to the other heroes that the five of them worked well together and suggested that they should combine to form a team to fight against threats that no lone hero could deal with. The Wasp proposes the name “Avengers” and thus <a href=\"/earth/4020-57183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57183\">Earth’s</a> Mightiest Heroes were formed. The original members are known as the \"founding members\" based on an Avengers Charter, to manage the good name of the team. As a result, their wishes regarding the direction of the team are given additional weight and deference.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Avengers were created by legendary comic creators <a href=\"/stan-lee/4040-40467/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\">Jack Kirby</a> and made their first appearance in <a href=\"/the-avengers/4050-2128/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2128\">The Avengers</a> #1 (Sep. 1963) in the story “The Coming of the Avengers”.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><h3>Founding Members</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/hank-pym/4005-2247/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2247\">Ant-Man</a></li><li><a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a></li><li><a href=\"/rick-jones/4005-2248/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2248\">Iron Man</a></li><li><a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a></li><li><a href=\"/wasp/4005-1502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1502\">Wasp</a></li><li>Captain America (Inducted as Founding Member after Hulk left)</li></ul><p>The founding members of Avengers, apart from Hulk, were already recognized and established as superheroes before the team formed. The public opinion of the Hulk at this time was very uncertain. Some thought he was a misunderstood creature who just wanted to be left alone. However mainly because of the efforts of <a href=\"/thunderbolt-ross/4005-3457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3457\">General “Thunderbolt” Ross</a>, the majority of public viewed The Hulk as a rampaging monster. Almost from the beginning the Avengers team roster has changed steadily, with the Hulk departing during their second adventure and <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a> joining soon after. The rotating roster has become a hallmark of the team although one theme has been constant - The Avengers fight the foes that no single superhero could defeat - hence their famous cry of \"Avengers Assemble!\"</p><p>The Avengers have always accepted a diverse range of members, regardless of their backgrounds, as long as they are ready to fight the good fight. To that end, the team has featured humans, <a href=\"/robots/4015-56059/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56059\">robots</a>, <a href=\"/mutant/4015-40656/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40656\">mutants</a>, Gods, <a href=\"/aliens/4015-46567/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-46567\">aliens</a>, supernatural beings and even former villains. Despite the diverse nature of the team, which often results in squabbling, the Avengers have always managed to unite into a stable unit to combat the deadliest threats in the universe.</p><p>Leadership of the group has varied over the years but has almost always fallen back to the hands of Captain America. Founding members Hank Pym, Iron Man, Thor and Wasp have also served extensively as leaders to different incarnations of the group. Other members have also taken up the role of leadership, to varying degrees of success, but the most prominent ones would be Hawkeye, Monica Rambeau, Ms. Marvel, Scarlet Witch, U.S.Agent and Vision.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>During their first team meeting there was immediate tension between the Avengers as Thor and Hulk exchanged words. Soon enough a body snatching <a href=\"/space-phantom/4005-7243/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7243\">Space Phantom</a> arrived with plans to destroy the Avengers to clear the path for an alien invasion. The Space Phantom switched bodies with each Avenger and planted seeds of distrust and hatred amongst them. It was clear that the other Avengers never truly trusted the Hulk and in fact admitted to each other they had him join their ranks to keep an eye on him. The Space Phantom managed to have the Hulk realize this distrust in the others and he left the team.</p><p>Soon afterwards The Hulk was befriended by <a href=\"/namor/4005-1476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\">Namor</a> the Sub-Mariner and the two <a href=\"/antiheroes/4015-55830/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55830\">antiheroes</a> formed an uneasy alliance to battle their common foe - humans. The Avengers, who were searching for the Hulk to prevent him from harming others, were tipped off by the Teen Brigade of his location. A confrontation took place between the Avengers, Namor and Hulk. But in the middle of the battle Hulk changed to Bruce Banner and left Namor to fight the Avengers alone. Clearly outgunned, Namor escaped.</p><h3>Captain America Joins The Avengers</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1979485\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101073/1979485-avengers2.png\" data-ratio=\"1.3913043478261\" data-width=\"575\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 575px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:139.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101073/1979485-avengers2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1979485\"><img alt=\"Captain America Lives Again\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/101073/1979485-avengers2.png\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101073/1979485-avengers2.png 575w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/101073/1979485-avengers2.png 460w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\" data-width=\"460\"></a><figcaption>Captain America Lives Again</figcaption></figure><p>After their previous battle Namor vows revenge on The Avengers. While swimming the seas the Sub-Mariner comes across an Eskimo tribe worshipping a figure encased in ice. Filled with wrath at the air breathers, the Prince of <a href=\"/atlantis/4020-41030/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41030\">Atlantis</a> hurls the block of ice into the ocean. The ice thaws as it heads towards warmer waters and the body inside is eventually discovered by The Avengers who are in a submarine searching for Namor. The heroes bring the floating body on board and realise it is Captain America, who has been in suspended animation since the Second World War. Thus the Living Legend of World War II is reborn! Initially Cap attacks The Avengers mistaking them as threats but the issue is quickly settled and The Avengers take Captain America back to <a href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\">New York</a> where he helps them defeat Namor and the alien <a href=\"/starhammer/4005-50246/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50246\">Vuk</a>. After their first battle together, Earth’s Mightiest Heroes offer membership to Captain America who gladly accepts. Cap would go on to become an embodiment of The Avengers and despite his later joining, given status as founding member.</p><p>The team's early adventures saw them battle <a href=\"/mole-man/4005-2481/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2481\">Mole Man</a>, <a href=\"/red-ghost/4005-2473/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2473\">Red Ghost</a>, <a href=\"/kang/4005-2264/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2264\">Kang the Conqueror</a>, <a href=\"/count-nefaria/4005-3229/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3229\">Count Nefaria</a> and cross paths with their former ally the Hulk multiple times.</p><h3>Masters of Evil</h3><p><a href=\"/baron-heinrich-zemo/4005-3708/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3708\">Baron Heinrich Zemo</a> finds out that Captain America is alive and has joined the ranks of the Avengers. Angered that his most hated foe is still alive, he forms a team of villains of his own. <a href=\"/black-knight-garrett/4005-73451/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-73451\">The Black Knight</a>, <a href=\"/melter/4005-7260/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7260\">Melter</a> and <a href=\"/radioactive-man/4005-4807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4807\">Radioactive Man</a> work together in Zemo's <a href=\"/masters-of-evil/4060-7582/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-7582\">Masters of Evil</a>. When the Avengers defeat the villains, Baron Zemo is joined by the Asgardian gods in exile the <a href=\"/executioner/4005-3517/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3517\">Executioner</a> and <a href=\"/enchantress/4005-7225/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7225\">Enchantress</a> and together with them free both the Black Knight and Melter to rejoin their ranks.</p><p>Their second attempt at defeating the Avengers goes no better, with the Enchantress seducing Thor and convincing him his fellow Avengers aren't what they seem in a bid to get him to defeat them and return to her arms. Unfortunately for the love-lorn Enchantress, Thor manages to shake off her influence and the Masters retreat to Zemo's base in the Amazon.</p><p>The Enchantress returns to New York to find a perfect candidate to for Zemo's Ion-powered machine. She found one in Simon Williams who was facing charges for embezzlement and was bitter at the man responsible for this: Tony Stark. Zemo transferred Simon into a living Ion-powered <a href=\"/wonder-man/4005-1465/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1465\">Wonder Man</a> and sent him to infiltrate the Avengers. Having gained the Avengers trust and being welcomed onto the team, Wonder Man betrays them to Zemo. However, Wonder Man begins to feel guilty for his betrayal and decides to turn the tables on Zemo and his allies, but ultimately wound up apparently dying in the Avengers arms due to his sacrifice.</p><p>After a disastrous skirmish with the Avengers due to Immortus, Baron Zemo kidnaps <a href=\"/rick-jones/4005-2248/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2248\">Rick Jones</a> and Captain America goes to South America to save him. Meanwhile back at the home-front the rest of the Avengers again confront the Masters of Evil and again defeat and subdue Black Knight and Melter, as Enchantress and Executioner escape. Elsewhere, Captain America finally confronts <a href=\"/baron-helmut-zemo/4005-3278/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3278\">Baron Zemo</a> in what would be their final confrontation, as during battle, an avalanche Zemo caused crushes the Nazi and kills him.</p><h3>Second Genesis</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2021136\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101073/2021136-31942_405932913855_829193855_4224791_3795513_n.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5046296296296\" data-width=\"432\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 432px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101073/2021136-31942_405932913855_829193855_4224791_3795513_n.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2021136\"><img alt=\"Second Generation\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px\" data-width=\"425\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/101073/2021136-31942_405932913855_829193855_4224791_3795513_n.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101073/2021136-31942_405932913855_829193855_4224791_3795513_n.jpg 432w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/101073/2021136-31942_405932913855_829193855_4224791_3795513_n.jpg 425w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Second Generation\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/101073/2021136-31942_405932913855_829193855_4224791_3795513_n.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101073/2021136-31942_405932913855_829193855_4224791_3795513_n.jpg 432w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/101073/2021136-31942_405932913855_829193855_4224791_3795513_n.jpg 425w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px\" data-width=\"425\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Second Generation</figcaption></figure><p>After the Wasp was almost killed in action and with the threat of the Masters of Evil halted, Giant Man and Wasp opted to retire from the Avengers. Thor, who was busy in Asgard, and Iron Man also withdrew from the team to instead focus on their personal lives. Captain America and Rick Jones remained behind as the team looked for replacement members. After inducting the adventurer Hawkeye who sought membership, the team tried to recruit the Sub-Mariner to no avail. After placing a classified ad seeking replacement Avengers, the former villains Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch replied and were welcomed onto the team. The new Avengers announced themselves to the public as Iron Man wished them luck.</p><p>The team were quick to recognize they lacked strength in their roster and wished to find another member. They first attempted to track down the Hulk and offer him a chance to rejoin the team but the plan ultimately failed. The team then inducted the mercenary known as Swordsman only for him to be sharply ejected due to the rest of the team no trusting him. The team halted their quest to battle against a variety of villains such as <a href=\"/atlas/4005-3277/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3277\">Power Man</a>, Kang and Doctor Doom.</p><p>The quest for a strong member of the team came to it's end when the Atlantean <a href=\"/attuma/4005-15779/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15779\">Attuma</a> attacked the surface world resulting in both Giant Man, who had re-established himself as Golaith, and Wasp returned to the team they helped found.

After helping the team against them, Hawkeye's girlfriend the <a href=\"/black-widow/4005-3200/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3200\">Black Widow</a> became a staunch ally and part-time Avenger incidentally was absent when the Avengers announced her as a full-time member. She continued to aid the team alongside her boyfriend.</p><p>The Enchantress sought revenge on the Avengers and duped the <a href=\"/olympian-gods/4060-44825/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-44825\">Olympian God</a> <a href=\"/hercules/4005-2503/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2503\">Hercules</a> into attacking the team. After a brief battle, Hercules manages to overcome the Enchantress' hold over him and then sides with the Avengers against her. Unfortunately for Hercules, his father, <a href=\"/zeus/4005-10226/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10226\">Zeus</a>, banishes him to Earth for a year for having left <a href=\"/olympus/4020-55673/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55673\">Olympus</a> without permission. Having felt his power first hand and knowing his ties to the Asgardian Thunder God, Thor, the Avengers invited Hercules stay with them and over time he eventually became a full-fledged member of the team during his stay on Earth.</p><p>Rick Jones also returned and, now outfitted in the costume of Captain America's former sidekick Bucky, became a more active part of the team - often accompanying Captain America as his sidekick. Despite finally achieving some degree of acceptance as both a part of the team and Captain America's sidekick, Rick Jones was still overlooked or treat like a peripheral part of the unit.</p><p>The team continued on with their larger roster and battled the likes of <a href=\"/diablo/4005-10242/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10242\">Diablo</a>, <a href=\"/dragon-man/4005-6823/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6823\">Dragon Man</a>, <a href=\"/sons-of-the-serpent/4060-24273/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-24273\">the Sons of the Serpent</a>, Sub-Mariner, <a href=\"/super-adaptoid/4005-10861/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10861\">Super-Adaptoid</a> and the Russian superhero, and ex-husband of Black Widow, <a href=\"/red-guardian-shostakov/4005-7581/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7581\">Red Guardian</a>. At the same time, the Avengers looked for a way to cure their team-mate Goliath, whom had become stuck at giant-size.</p><h3>Depleting Numbers</h3><p>The Mandarin organized a new Masters of Evil group in a gambit to destroy the Avengers and his arch-nemesis Iron Man once and for all. The former Masters of Evil members Enchantress and Executioner were joined by <a href=\"/living-laser/4005-9904/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9904\">Living Laser</a>, Power Man and Swordsman and sent to defeat the Avengers. Despite having their largest roster yet, the Avengers were briefly rejoined by both Iron Man and Thor to battle against the Mandarin's team of villains. Iron Man and Thor both left the group again after Mandarin and his cronies were defeated.</p><p>The tides quickly changed for the Avengers as the team began to fall apart. After the death of her ex-husband, the Black Widow left both Hawkeye and the Avengers and Captain America opted out of the team to establish a life of his own apart from the team. Rick Jones followed Captain America and eventually resigned altogether after he was beaten by the Red Skull disguised as Cap. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch were next to leave after <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto</a> (who unbeknownst to anyone involved, was their biological father) captured them both and tried to convince them to join his new Brotherhood of Mutants. In the skirmish that followed, Scarlet Witch was injured which led to both her and Quicksilver withdrawing from the team. Finally, Hercules left the team after a battle with Typhon in which upon the climax he was welcomed back into Olympus by his father.</p><h3>Filling in the Blanks</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4466303-8434729350-ca914.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4466303\" data-ratio=\"1.5080428954424\" data-width=\"746\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 746px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4466303-8434729350-ca914.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4466303\"><img alt=\"Black Panther and Vision join the team\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px\" data-width=\"424\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4466303-8434729350-ca914.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4466303-8434729350-ca914.jpg 746w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4466303-8434729350-ca914.jpg 636w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4466303-8434729350-ca914.jpg 424w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Black Panther and Vision join the team\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4466303-8434729350-ca914.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4466303-8434729350-ca914.jpg 746w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4466303-8434729350-ca914.jpg 636w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4466303-8434729350-ca914.jpg 424w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px\" data-width=\"424\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Black Panther and Vision join the team</figcaption></figure><p>With only Goliath, Hawkeye and Wasp left, the team continued on admirably despite their lack in both numbers and power.

The mixture of different chemicals triggers a new persona, and Hank now calls himself Yellowjacket. This persona is more confident and free willed, a total opposite to his current personality. After thwarting and bashing some thugs, Hank enters the <a href=\"/avengers-mansion/4020-41036/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41036\">Avengers Mansion</a> and wants to join their ranks. He makes claims that his Yellowjacket persona killed his Goliath persona. The Avengers didn’t take the news likely, so Hank grabs the Wasp and escapes to his miniature base outside the mansion. Hank then kisses the Wasp, and from that point-on the Wasp knows it is actually Hank.</p><p>The two decide to get married, and tons of superheroes make their way to the wedding of Yellowjacket and the Wasp.

Throwing aside his bow and arrows, Hawkeye decides to use Hank Pym's old Goliath chemicals and equipment and adopts the Goliath guise himself and frees the Black Widow.</p><h3>Let the Game Begin</h3><p>The <a href=\"/grandmaster/4005-32735/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32735\">Grandmaster</a> and <a href=\"/kang/4005-2264/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2264\">Kang</a> plays a game of chess for the life of Kang's dead love, <a href=\"/ravonna/4005-7222/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7222\">Ravonna</a>. The Avengers are used as pawns. Kang and his team of Avengers win, and the Grandmaster offers Kang a choice to destroy the Avengers or save his beloved.

At the conclusion, the Black Knight officially becomes a Avenger.</p><p>Not long after this, Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch return from the team.

The Sentinels kidnap Scarlet Witch and take her to their base in Australia, where they plot to eradicate mutants once and for all. The Sentinels plan to use a massive solar flare to sterilize all of the humans on Earth, which they believe will prevent the birth of future mutants. The Avengers manage to defeat the Sentinels, but Quicksilver (who had earlier broken away from the group and traveled to Australia without the others) is seriously injured, and ends up being left behind since the other Avengers are unaware of his presence. He nearly dies, but is rescued by <a href=\"/crystal/4005-2115/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2115\">Crystal</a>, who brings him to the hidden kingdom of<a href=\"/attilan/4020-44155/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-44155\"> Attilan</a> to recover.</p><p>Not long after this, <a href=\"/mantis/4005-3324/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3324\">Mantis</a> and <a href=\"/swordsman/4005-3795/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3795\">Swordsman</a> also join the team.

Kang believes that by forcing the Madonna to marry him, he will have control over the child once it is born.</p><p>The Celestial Madonna is eventually revealed to be Mantis, and Swordsman ends up being killed by Kang while trying to protect her. The Vision and Scarlet Witch end up marrying one another after this, while Mantis departs for space.</p><h3>The Serpent Crown</h3><p>Twin threats to time and space as campaigns by Kang and the Crown coincide! The Avengers fight the Set-serving Squadron Supreme in a clash between Earths and head for the nineteenth century to keep the West from getting wilder! Continuity questions continue as Kang and Immortus mix it up! Plus: the menace of...

After having momentarily upset the Cosmic order of the Universe by eliminating <a href=\"/death/4005-12620/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12620\">Death</a> (only to restore the concept after realizing his mistake), the Beyonder decided that he might as well just destroy the entire universe because it confuses him.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2805874\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2805874-bey.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.72360248447205\" data-width=\"966\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 966px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:72.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2805874-bey.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2805874\"><img alt=\"Avengers vs. Beyonder\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2805874-bey.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2805874-bey.jpg 966w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11/117763/2805874-bey.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/117763/2805874-bey.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2805874-bey.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Avengers vs. Beyonder\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2805874-bey.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2805874-bey.jpg 966w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11/117763/2805874-bey.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/117763/2805874-bey.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2805874-bey.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Avengers vs. Beyonder</figcaption></figure><p>The Avengers attempted to intercept the Beyonder, but alone were no match for him and were easily defeated by the Beyonder within the blink of an eye. The Beyonder continued in his plot, in the process murdering the entirety of the New Mutants who attempted to stop him. The Avengers regrouped and called in assistance from the X-Men, Fantastic Four, Alpha Flight and many former Avengers, and attempted again to defeat the Beyonder but still proved insufficient to the task. It wasn't until the one-time villain the <a href=\"/molecule-man/4005-11880/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11880\">Molecule Man</a> arrived that the tide changed for the heroes.</p><p>Battling against the Beyonder, the Molecule Man still wasn't powerful enough and required the heroes to also aid him in battle as a means of distracting the Beyonder from directing all his focus on him. Eventually, the Beyonder was defeated but it seemed too late as the cataclysmic battle between Beyonder and Molecule Man had seemingly doomed the planet to virtual destruction within mere hours.</p><p>Gravely weakened from his battle with the Beyonder, the Molecule Man was pleaded by the Avengers to fix the damage done to the planet in the battle. Not confident in his abilities or strength to do so, the Molecule Man took some convincing by the heroes but eventually rescinded to save the planet even if it meant the strain could kill him. The Molecule Man was successful but it appeared the strain had robbed him of his powers. The Avengers thanked him for his much needed help in the Beyonder conflict and allowed him to leave and live out his life with the Avengers promising not to pursue him for his former crimes.</p><p>Returning home, the Molecule Man revealed to the <a href=\"/silver-surfer/4005-2502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\">Silver Surfer</a> that he did indeed still have his powers and it was all a show for the Avengers because he was afraid if the Avengers knew his powers were still active they wouldn't stop hounding him or trying to get him to do something with his powers when all he wants to do is live a normal life with his wife. The Silver Surfer promised to keep the secret and left, the Avengers none the wiser.</p><h3>Absolute Vision</h3><p>Around this same time, Vision is nearly killed during a battle with <a href=\"/annihilus/4005-10964/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10964\">Annihilus</a>. Starfox attempts to help Vision recuperate by connecting him to <a href=\"/isaac/4005-22002/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22002\">I.S.A.A.C</a>., a powerful computer on his home world of <a href=\"/titan/4020-41103/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41103\">Titan</a>. Though this does help with Vision's recovery, it also leads to him going mad and believing that the only way to save the world is to conquer it. To that end, he begins manipulating his teammates, and even engineers the formation of a spin-off group based in California, known as the <a href=\"/avengers-west-coast/4060-29075/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-29075\">West Coast Avengers</a>. Hawkeye leads the California based group, with the rest of the initial lineup consisting of <a href=\"/mockingbird/4005-2497/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2497\">Mockingbird</a>, the new Iron Man (<a href=\"/war-machine/4005-1926/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1926\">James Rhodes</a>, who took over the role after Tony Stark suffered a severe alcohol relapse), <a href=\"/tigra/4005-21188/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21188\">Tigra </a>and Wonder Man.</p><p>Though Vision's scheme is eventually thwarted, the West Coast branch of the Avengers remains active. Vision regains his sanity and steps down from the team to face the consequences of his actions, but not before the government begins placing increased scrutiny on the Avengers.</p><h3>Hydrobase</h3><p>Due to continued hassling from the government, the Avengers eventually lost their flight privileges within city limits. The team was soon contacted by the aquatic hero known as <a href=\"/stingray/4005-3320/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3320\">Stingray</a>, who offered to let the Avengers use <a href=\"/avengers-island/4020-57019/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57019\">Hydrobase</a> to land and launch their Quinjets. It was at Hydrobase that the Avengers encountered their former foe Namor, who had since been ousted from his kingdom of Atlantis. Remembering how Namor fought alongside the Invaders during World War 2, Captain America offered the Atlantean membership in the Avengers in order to help redeem him.</p><h3>Betrayed</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6337765-east%20and%20west.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6337765\" data-ratio=\"0.44241573033708\" data-width=\"712\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 712px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:44.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6337765-east%20and%20west.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6337765\"><img alt=\"Both teams of Avengers together\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6337765-east%20and%20west.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6337765-east%20and%20west.jpg 712w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6337765-east%20and%20west.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Both teams of Avengers together\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6337765-east%20and%20west.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6337765-east%20and%20west.jpg 712w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6337765-east%20and%20west.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Both teams of Avengers together</figcaption></figure><p>When the East and West Coast Avengers teams meet for a baseball game, they're attacked by <a href=\"/freedom-force/4050-22698/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-22698\">Freedom Force</a>, a government-sponsored team led by <a href=\"/mystique/4005-1469/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1469\">Mystique</a>. The Avengers are soon overpowered and taken into custody, and it is revealed that the government ordered that the heroes be arrested. The heroes are told that a former member of the team betrayed them and revealed that they were complicit in certain criminal actions, including Vision's earlier plot to conquer the planet. Though the Avengers plead their innocence, they are not believed.</p><p>After being released by <a href=\"/julia-carpenter/4005-16197/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-16197\">Spider-Woman</a>, the Avengers set out to discover which of their former teammates betrayed them. After calling in several reserve members, the heroes learn that it was Quicksilver who turned against them and framed them for the crimes they are accused of. Quicksilver is revealed to have become mentally unhinged after his wife cheated on him, and also still harbors a grudge over the incident where he was unknowingly abandoned after the fight with the Sentinels. Quicksilver works with the members of <a href=\"/zodiac/4060-41170/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41170\">Zodiac</a> to destroy his old teammates, but is forced to flee after being thwarted.

The villains first began to discredit the Avengers by turning the public against Namor, with citizens soon expressing outrage at a violent former villain being allowed on the team. The villains later set a trap for Hercules and brutally beat him, nearly killing him. With the first phase of their plan complete, the Masters of Evil then stormed Avengers Mansion, and took several members of the team (including Captain America, Black Knight and Jarivs) prisoner.</p><p>With help from some reinforcements, the remaining Avengers were eventually able to reenter the mansion and rescue their comrades. During the final battle atop the mansion's roof, Baron Zemo fell from a great height, ending his threat. Though the Masters of Evil were ultimately defeated, Jarvis was severely injured, and ended up losing the use of one of his eyes for an extended period. The villains also destroyed Captain America's keepsakes from his youth, including the only remaining photograph of his deceased mother. Hercules was also rendered comatose due to his injuries.</p><p><a href=\"/doctor-druid/4005-10302/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10302\">Doctor Druid</a>, a hero who had proven key in defeating the Masters of Evil, stayed on and joined the Avengers as an official member. Due to the damage inflicted on the mansion, the Avengers decided to relocate their entire operation to Hydrobase. Captain Marvel also ends up being appointed as team leader after Wasp takes a leave of absence.</p><h3>The X-Men vs. the Avengers</h3><p>Doctor Druid and Captain America arrive at a Mansfield, Ohio shopping mall, ordering the security guard to give the place their attention. They then force the crowd to listen to them and evacuate slowly, using Doctor Druid's hypnotic power. Up above the Earth's atmosphere, the rest of the Avengers, Captain Marvel, Thor, She-Hulk, and Black Knight, are attempting to stop a huge meteor shower. She-Hulk and Black Knight, in a Quinjet, nearly are killed, but are saved by Thor. The government realizes what the asteroids were when they see how magnetic it is, as well as the straps of metal embedded in it.</p><p>In Russia, the Soviet Super soldiers are stopping a runaway train with the help of the Crimson Dynamo. The Soviet Super-Soldiers express their hated of the man, but agree to let him join their ranks, as he is still Russian. In an isolated cove along the Atlantic shore, six X-Men are vacationing. (Dazzler, Magneto, Havok, Storm, Wolverine, and Rogue). All are enjoying themselves except for Havok, who is letting off steam. Magneto sneaks away from the group when he hears the announcement of the fallen asteroids, and takes off. Back at the Avengers Hydrobase, the team is discussing the Asteroids, which now have been revealed as pieces of Asteroid M. They all recount past deeds of him, and agree it is their duty to go after him. In Kampuchea, Magneto is looking for his lost pieces of Asteroid M when he is confronted by the Avengers, who want him to stop. The X-Men come to his aid when he is being beaten. Lastly, the Soviet Super-Soldiers come and attack both groups in an attempt to take Magneto for themselves.</p><p>After a quick recap, a three way battle erupts between the Avengers, Soviet Super Soldiers, and the X-Men. As the Soviets and Avengers duke it out, the X-Men take the opportunity to flee, taking Magneto with them. Dazzler stops Captain America and Crimson Dynamo after they attempt to follow her. After the X-Men escape, the Avengers trick Darkstar to trap all her teammates in her dark energy constructs, departing and leaving them all trapped for another hour by their own teammate. While they do this, Magneto departs the X-Men group to go look for the asteroid on his own. Captain Marvel spies on the X-Men's location using her powers, and relays it off to her team, the Avengers. Magneto finds a huge chunk of his asteroid, including one of his old costumes, and he puts his old helmet on. The Avengers arrive and attack him, nearly defeating him.</p><p>The X-Men then come to his aide, and as the two teams fight, Magneto tells them that the Asteroid is rigged with an explosion. Using the explosion as a distraction, Magneto takes the X-Men in their jet and flee, but apparently unknown to the X-Men, Doctor Druid is stowed away in the back of the Blackbird. The Soviet Super Soldiers, still trapped in the predicament from last issue, finally break free early, as Gremlin exits his armor and shakes Darkstar, releasing them from her powers. They all agree to go after Magneto once more, for his crimes long ago. On the Blackbird, the X-Men are discuss things. Magneto remains quiet about all the things going on with the Asteroid. Druid, still in the jet believes he is hiding something, and Magneto seems to realize that Druid is actually there. Druid then tries to make contact with the Avengers, before the X-Men attack him, as Magneto realized he was there. Rogue absorbs his powers and memories and tells them all that he didn't give away their location. All three teams then arrive in Singapore, after Druid awakens and alerts the Avengers.</p><p>Vanguard recognizes Havok in the streets, but is attacked by Wolverine before he can do anything. Rogue then absorbs his powers and memories and the entire X-Men team flees to a ship on the bay. There, Storm confronts Magneto.</p><p>The Soviets arrive at the ship and attack the X-Men, but during the battle, Crimson Dynamo purposely causes the ship to sink. The Avengers arrive, and all three teams assist in the evacuation of the boat. Crimson Dynamo's actions are revealed, and Magneto escapes once more. The Avengers barge into a Singapore office, demanding that they be given some sort of information on Mangeto. The government is tight-lipped, but the matter has become internation, so the Avengers demand they tell them. The leader is then called, and Magneto has been spotted. It is also revealed that the X-Men have turned themselves over.</p><p>Magneto is wandering the streets when someone recognizes him, causing something of a riot. He is found by three mutants, Crawler, Slider, and Leiko, who bring him to the Light. The Light finally trusts him that he is Magneto, and they all rejoice at his arrival, as they have been waiting for him. They are then attacked and Magneto helps them win, and then flees. The X-Men, tired of waiting to be either prosocuted or not, escape the van and fly away with it to freedom. The Avengers then meet with Mr. Ronalds, who is angry that the Avengers will not go after the escaped X-Men.</p><p>Magneto is modifying his helmet with Leiko, when the Avengers finally confront the X-Men, revealing that they were following them to attempt to find Magneto's location. Magneto teleports all Avengers but Captain America away, and consults with them. He surrenders himself to the government. Back at Xavier Mansion, Psylocke and Longshot watch the Magneto trial on television. The trial does not look to be going well on Magneto's side, and he is getting frustrated. It is revealed that Leiko and Slider were killed when Magneto was taken, and only Crawler lived form a riot attack. Magneto uses his helmet to set himself free from the trial, much to the people's anger.</p><h3>Nothing Lasts Forever</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6336764-avengers%20end.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6336764\" data-ratio=\"1.5404208194906\" data-width=\"903\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 903px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6336764-avengers%20end.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6336764\"><img alt=\"The final days of Captain Marvel's Avengers\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 415px) 100vw, 415px\" data-width=\"415\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6336764-avengers%20end.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6336764-avengers%20end.jpg 903w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6336764-avengers%20end.jpg 623w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6336764-avengers%20end.jpg 415w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The final days of Captain Marvel's Avengers\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6336764-avengers%20end.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6336764-avengers%20end.jpg 903w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6336764-avengers%20end.jpg 623w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6336764-avengers%20end.jpg 415w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 415px) 100vw, 415px\" data-width=\"415\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The final days of Captain Marvel's Avengers</figcaption></figure><p>The Avengers were eventually hunted down and captured by the Greek gods, and were brought before <a href=\"/zeus/4005-10226/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10226\">Zeus</a>, Hercules' father. Zeus blamed the Avengers for his son's injuries, and sought to punish the heroes by sentencing them to death by torture in the realm of Hades. However, the heroes fought back against Zeus' forces, and Hercules eventually recovered enough to dissuade his father from harming his friends. Though no longer in a coma, Hercules could not return to Earth with his teammates, and remained with his fellow gods to recover from his wounds. Upon their return to Earth, Namor's new wife <a href=\"/marrina/4005-12600/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12600\">Marrina </a>was made a part of the team as an honorary Avenger. The Avengers later faced a team of robotic villains known as <a href=\"/heavy-metal/4060-55803/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55803\">Heavy Metal</a>.</p><p>Posing as the space pirate <a href=\"/nebula/4005-14558/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14558\">Nebula</a>, the time traveler <a href=\"/ravonna/4005-27265/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27265\">Ravonna</a> began influencing Doctor Druid, manipulating him into plotting a coup against Captain Marvel. Tragedy soon struck when Marrina's alien DNA caused her to transform into a gigantic monster known as the Leviathan. Namor was ultimately forced to kill Marrina to end her suffering, and left the Avengers in sorrow. The battle with Leviathan also left Captain Marvel badly wounded and near death, resulting in her resigning from the team. This allowed Doctor Druid to influence the other Avengers into electing him team leader, which was all part of Ravonna's plan.</p><p>The situation continued to get progressively worse as time went on, such as Black Knight falling victim to the curse of his <a href=\"/ebony-blade/4055-46939/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-46939\">Ebony Blade</a>, and Ravonna brainwashing the team into helping her in her goals. This adventure resulted in Nebula and Doctor Druid disappearing into the time stream. After returning to Hydrobase, the few remaining Avengers chose to go their separate ways, effectively disbanding the team.</p><h3>Evolutionary War</h3><p>The <a href=\"/high-evolutionary/4005-13346/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13346\">High Evolutionary</a> attempts to evolve the human race into a more advanced species using various schemes such as drugs, eradicating mutants, and a genetic bomb. To combat this threat, Steve Rogers (known simply as The Captain at the time) assembled a team of reserve Avengers consisting of himself, Falcon, Beast, the Hulk (now using his Joe Fixit alias),<a href=\"/yellowjacket-demara/4005-1501/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1501\"> Yellowjacket</a> and Hercules. Hercules and the High Evolutionary both appear to perish during a heated battle, which allows the remaining Avengers to disable the genetic bomb.</p><h3>Inferno</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6337695-avengers%20line-up%20change.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6337695\" data-ratio=\"0.71666666666667\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:71.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6337695-avengers%20line-up%20change.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6337695\"><img alt=\"Cap unveils his plan for a revolving lineup\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6337695-avengers%20line-up%20change.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6337695-avengers%20line-up%20change.jpg 600w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6337695-avengers%20line-up%20change.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Cap unveils his plan for a revolving lineup\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6337695-avengers%20line-up%20change.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6337695-avengers%20line-up%20change.jpg 600w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6337695-avengers%20line-up%20change.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Cap unveils his plan for a revolving lineup</figcaption></figure><p>After the High Evolutionary is defeated, the reserve Avengers do not stay together.

The Shi'ar Imperial Guard come to steal the technology left by the deceased Captain Marvel while Kree agents try to secure their loose technology, getting the attention of the Avengers. Earth's Mightiest Heroes learn not only of the intergalactic war taking place but that their solar system is being used as a strategic hyperspace stop and it is severely destabilizing their sun.</p><p>The east coast branch of the Avengers unite with the Avengers West Coast and divide into three teams. One team remains on Earth while the other two journey to the respective throneworlds of the Shi'ar and Kree to find some way of protecting Earth from this war. These space-bound teams are quickly embroiled in conspiracy within both alien empires. The Shi'ar team expose Skrull infiltrators deep within the Shi'ar ruling body, and the Kree team become fugitives as the Supreme Intelligence rises to rule the Kree once more. Even with the conspiracies becoming clear, the war continues with a life of its own. The Shi'ar complete their Nega-Bomb, an unprecedented weapon of mass destruction, and the Avengers are unable to stop Lilandra from deploying it against the Kree. Its detonation ends the war, killing millions upon millions of Kree.</p><p>The Avengers survive and discover the true architect of all this death is the Supreme Intelligence, who sacrificed countless lives so that the few surviving Kree would break free of their evolutionary dead end thanks to the Nega-Bomb's fallout. This leads to half of the Avengers to decide to hunt down the Supreme Intelligence in the ruins of the Kree Empire and execute him for his crimes, despite Captain America's strong objections.

Despite his powers, Thanos realizes his mission is near impossible. Remembering the Infinity Gems that were instrumental in his death, he peered into the Infinity Well to discover their secrets. He divines the true nature of the gems, and their current owners.</p><p>Thanos discovers that the Infinity Gems are currently in possession of the Elders of the Universe with the Soul Gem in possession of the In-Betweener. With cunning, Thanos is able to obtain possession of the gems. He then places the gems on the Infinity Gauntlet, and becomes the most powerful being in the universe.</p><p>Thanos immediately fulfills his objective and kills half of all life in the universe. He also brings a tortured Nebula (who alleges to be his granddaughter) as a sacrifice to Death. But because Thanos is so powerful, becoming superior to Death in every facet, Thanos' hope of being treated as an equal escapes his grasp. He gleans from Death that they are not equal, and Death becomes subservient to him. This infuriates Thanos who doesn't want Death as a slave but as a lover.

Mephisto arrives and advises Thanos to remove his omniscience to make the fight somewhat fair in the hopes of impressing Death. Despite the machinations of Mephisto, the battle is grueling and over quickly for the heroes. Thanos dispatched the heroes with ease. Some examples of the carnage include Terraxia murdering Spider-Man and decapitating Iron Man. The X-men fared no better, as Wolverine had his adamantium skeleton turned to spongy rubber and Cyclops had his head trapped in a cube, stopping his optic blasts and suffocating him. Cosmic heroes like Nova was turned into small cubes, and with Quasar, Thanos causes the Quantum Bands upon his wrists to explode and then disintegrated him. Fearsome foes like Thor were turned to glass. The last man standing was Captain America, who made his last stand. Absent from the battle and light years away were the Silver Surfer and Adam Warlock, who knew and fully expected the frontal assault to fail. The key to the real strategy was Mephisto's involvement. After shattering Captain America's shield, Thanos raised his fist to deliver the final blow. This was the cue for Adam Warlock's true plan to go into effect as Surfer rushed in to steal the gauntlet. This gambit failed, and Thanos realized how close he was to failure himself. He once again reinstated his omniscience, and became all-powerful, all-knowing once again.</p><p>It was then that the Cosmic forces themselves attacked. The mighty forces, each near-omnipotent on their own, were no match for the omnipotence the Infinity Gauntlet bestowed upon Thanos. Eternity and Thanos had a final epic battle where Thanos perseveres, becoming the embodiment of this universe's reality. Thanos sheds his mortal form and takes his place Eternity's replacement. Nebula seizes this opportunity to take the gauntlet from the former body of Thanos. Thanos realizes his error and joins with the remaining heroes and cosmic forces to defeat the now omnipotent Nebula. Their relentless attack on the confused Gauntlet wielder allows Adam Warlock to enter the Soul Gem, a gem he is intimately attached to. From within the Soul Gem he links with the other Infinity Gems and causes the gems to feedback on Nebula, causing her to remove it.</p><p>Adam Warlock then becomes wielder of the Gauntlet. In an attempt to be a \"perfect\" god, Warlock's first use of the power was to expel from his soul the Good and Evil. This was the first step to his reign as God. But before he can begin, the Living Tribunal appears and deems Warlock too unstable and therefore unfit to wield the power. He didn't appear previously because he knew that Thanos wouldn't upset the delicate balance of the universe. Without morals or vices, with his sole focus of being a god being undermined, Warlock violently reacts to the Living Tribunal's judgment. The Living Tribunal dismisses Warlock's uses of the Gauntlet and deems that they would no longer be able to function together, preventing anyone from achieving omnipotence through possession of the gems. The gems separate, and Adam Warlock forms Infinity Watch to safeguard the powerful and dangerous Infinity Gems.

The Proctor uses these alternate heroes to form a team known as the <a href=\"/gatherers/4060-29919/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-29919\">Gatherers</a>, who scour various parallel universes to find surviving heroes for his cause. The Avengers first encounter the Gatherer after being led into a trap by two <a href=\"/magdalene/4005-7251/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7251\">Magdalene</a> and <a href=\"/swordsman-jarvert/4005-2504/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2504\">Swordsman</a>, two members of the group.</p><p>The Avengers proceed to have further encounters with the Gatherers, including an incident where the villains try to kill Black Panther. The Avengers thwart this plan and take Swordsman prisoner, while the other Gatherers escape. The heroes learn that Swordsman is not actually a villain, and had been manipulated and lied to by the Proctor. Bothered by this setback, the Proctor arranges for Vision to be kidnapped and replaced by <a href=\"/anti-vision/4005-25908/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25908\">an alternate universe counterpar</a>t, who infiltrates the Avengers in order to kill Swordsman. The Avengers eventually discover the ruse, and confront the Proctor. Before escaping, the Proctor reveals to his Avengers that his world had been destroyed by its version of Sersi, who was driven mad by an Eternal mental deterioration known as the Mahd W'yry.</p><p>The Avengers become concerned that their version of Sersi may also be suffering from the Mahd W'yry, as she had become increasingly aggressive and erratic in the preceding weeks. This is not helped by her attraction to Black Knight, who is in love with Crystal. The love triangle is complicated even further by the return of Quicksilver, Crystal's husband, who has been staying at the mansion in order to recover from the injuries dealt to him by Exodus during the <a href=\"/bloodties/4045-42241/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-42241\">Bloodties</a> incident. Sersi begins experiencing seizures and blackouts, and becomes the suspect in a murder investigation after several men she spoke to are found dead.</p><p>The Proctor eventually kidnaps Sersi and reveals that he was his world's version of Black Knight, and had fallen in love with his world's Sersi prior to her mental deterioration. After the alternate Sersei broke up with him and went insane, he killed her with the Ebony Blade, and began traveling across the <a href=\"/marvel-multiverse/4015-56201/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56201\">Multiverse</a>, killing each alternate version of Sersi he encountered. He also confesses that he had used the mental link he had with his world's Sersi to worsen this Sersi's mental state, and also killed the young men to frame her.</p><p>The Avengers arrive to rescue their teammate and end up in a battle with the Gatherers. Sersi eventually frees herself and uses the Ebony Blade to kill the Proctor, an act which shocks her teammates. Realizing that the Mahd W'yry will soon consume her, Sersi opts to leave for the <a href=\"/ultraverse/4015-49479/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-49479\">Ultraverse</a>, a reality where she will no longer experience her illness. Black Knight chooses to go with her, having realized that he loves her, and that Crystal will never be his.

After subduing the two mutant villains, the Avengers rush off to the final battle with Onslaught, who has evolved into an even more powerful form. During the final battle, the Hulk manages to crack Onslaught's armor, transforming the creature into a being of pure psionic energy. Realizing that the energy needs physical form in order to be destroyed, Thor sacrifices himself to try and hold Onslaught. The Fantastic Four, Captain America, Wasp, Giant-Man, Black Panther, Iron Man, Scarlet Witch, Namor, Hawkeye, Crystal and Bruce Banner (after having been separated from the Hulk) follow Thor's lead, giving up their lives to contain Onslaught. With Onslaught trapped, the X-Men combine their attacks to finish him off, destroying him.</p><p>In the aftermath, the world mourns the fallen Avengers. Black Widow (who had been leading the team at the time of the battle with Onslaught) suffers intense guilty over the deaths, but resolves to carry on the team's legacy. She attempts to form a new line-up of Avengers, and approaches Angel, Iceman, <a href=\"/ant-man-lang/4005-20577/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20577\">Scott Lang</a>, She-Hulk, <a href=\"/moondragon/4005-7214/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7214\">Moondragon</a> and War Machine, but is rejected by each of them. With the founding Avengers gone, two congressmen file a motion to annul the team's government charter, causing an even greater strain. Black Widow ultimately chooses to officially disband the Avengers, and shuts down the mansion. Several former members of the team (namely Black Knight, She-Hulk and Hercules) later leave to form the new <a href=\"/heroes-for-hire/4060-23588/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-23588\">Heroes for Hire</a>.

In this time of extraordinary crisis, the nations of the world turn to the only organization capable of leading them through the ensuing strife and restoring political, economic and social order: the Avengers. The Avengers manage to restore the cities after thwarting the plans of Scorpio, the mastermind behind the disappearances.</p><p>As a result of the leadership displayed by the Avengers, they are once again granted United Nations clearance, with Avengers Mansion becoming Avengers Embassy.

When a group of peasants are brutally murdered by their own Slokovian government because they worship Thor, Thor is furious and comes down to earth from Asgard to avenge those people.

They are again seemingly destroyed only to be brought back to life again when the universe is restored to how it once was.</p><h3>Red Zone</h3><p>A deadly red mist containing a flesh-eating virus starts to spread in the USA killing thousand of people. It is eventually revealed to be the work of the Red Skull, who has infiltrated the U.S. government by posing as a politician named Dell Rusk.

However, Jack of Hearts' radiation-absorption powers accidentally cause She-Hulk to transform into a larger, more frenzied form, and she ends up fleeing into the unknown.</p><h3>Search for She-Hulk</h3><p>The Avengers eventually track She-Hulk to a small town, where a massive fight ensues. The intervention of Hawkeye and the Hulk eventually allows the heroes to resolve the crisis, and She-Hulk is returned to normal. In the aftermath of this event, the Avengers come to the conclusion that Jack and She-Hulk cannot both remain as members of the team, as another accident could occur.

This divided the super-human community, which literally became a super-human <a href=\"/civil-war/4045-40615/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40615\">Civil War</a>, leading to multiple conflicts between Iron Man and S.H.I.E.L.D. with Cap's \" <a href=\"/secret-avengers/4060-40904/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40904\">Secret Avengers</a>,\" and left friendships and relationships broken, familirs divided, friends turned into bitter enemies, and the death of few individuals, such as Bill Foster, Goliath. The war only ended when Captain America finally surrendered after seeing the harm the war was doing, but this only ended in more bloodshed as Captain America was <a href=\"/fallen-son-the-death-of-captain-america/4045-54540/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-54540\">assassinated</a> shortly after surrendering.</p><h3>The Initiative</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-160532\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5922/160532-118170-mighty-avengers.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.3275\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:132.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5922/160532-118170-mighty-avengers.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-160532\"><img alt=\"The people's Avengers\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px\" data-width=\"482\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5922/160532-118170-mighty-avengers.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5922/160532-118170-mighty-avengers.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The people's Avengers\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5922/160532-118170-mighty-avengers.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5922/160532-118170-mighty-avengers.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px\" data-width=\"482\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The people's Avengers</figcaption></figure><p>For further details: <a href=\"/the-initiative/4045-53970/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-53970\">the Initiative</a></p><p>Minutes after this new Avengers team had been assembled, New York City came under attack by the <a href=\"/mole-man/4005-2481/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2481\">Mole Man</a>'s monsters and the Mighty Avengers were called into action..</p><p>The battle against the Mole Man's forces went well even though it forced the new team to work out the kinks of its new group dynamic in the field, but the crisis took a terrible swerve with the unexpected arrival of <a href=\"/ultron/4005-2242/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2242\">Ultron</a>. Ultron hacked into Iron Man's new Extremis system and not only overrode Tony Stark but physically transformed him into a nude replica of Janet Van Dyne. Ultron's fixation with the Wasp became so warped that he turned himself into her as an expression of his love, making himself into a herself. Ultron also hacked into Tony Stark's unfinished network of weather control satellites, causing natural disasters all over the world with the intent of making Earth inhospitable to human life. When the Mighty Avengers discovered this, Wonder Man and the Sentry quickly destroyed the satellites. Ultron then switched tactics and began decoding missile launch codes while fighting the team. Only one missile was successfully launched, and Ms. Marvel detonated it safely in the air.

With Iron Man, Ms. Marvel and Sentry no longer being part of the group, and Captain America being dead, the team was initially underpowered. However, their ranks were soon joined by <a href=\"/doctor-strange/4005-1456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\">Doctor Strange</a>, who allowed the Avengers to use the <a href=\"/sanctum-sanctorum/4020-55966/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55966\">Sanctum Sanctorum</a> as their new base of operations. <a href=\"/iron-fist/4005-1492/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1492\">Iron Fist</a>, Luke's longtime friend and former crime-fighting partner, also joined the team during this period.</p><p>Clint Barton later returned to New York after having been resurrected by Scarlet Witch following the events of <em>House of M</em>. With his Hawkeye identity having been taken over by Kate Bishop after his \"death,\" Clint was left without a costume or moniker. He eventually took the Ronin name and costume that had previously been used by Echo, and switched from his trademark bow and arrow to a katana. As Ronin, Clint joined the New Avengers, and took part in many of their adventures.</p><p>The New Avengers once again clashed with the Hand after learning that they had kidnapped Echo and were planning to brainwash her. During the ensuing battle, <a href=\"/elektra/4005-1802/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1802\">Elektra</a>, the leader of the Hand, attempted to kill Doctor Strange. However, at the last moment, Echo snapped out of her brainwashed state and stabbed Elektra with a katana, killing her. However, after her death, the assassin's body transformed into a green-skinned alien, revealing that the woman who had been thought to be Elektra was actually a shape-shifting <a href=\"/skrulls/4060-40668/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40668\">Skrull</a><a href=\"/elektra-pagon/4005-54515/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54515\"> impostor</a>.

To that end, information was leaked that <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a> was alive and in a holding facility. None of this was true. It was bait to lure the New Avengers into a trap, and it worked. The New Avengers suddenly found themselves facing off against the Mighty Avengers. Rather than a fight, Iron Man activated a neural net device meant to dampen their powers. It worked, but the Mighty Avengers did not count on Doctor Strange being with Luke's team. The device did not work on his magic, which allowed Strange to teleport the New Avengers back to his home, which was mystically disguised as a vacant building.</p><p>No one on the Mighty Avengers could see through the illusion Dr. Strange had cast upon his home, but that did not mean they believed it. They recruited <a href=\"/brother-voodoo/4005-10280/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10280\">Brother Voodoo</a>'s assistance to break the illusion, but he was unable to defeat Dr. Strange's magics and admitted as much to the team.

This weapon was based off of the <a href=\"/venom/4005-1486/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\">Venom symbiote</a>, releasing a plague of symbiotes that transformed the population of New York into Venom-like monsters. The Mighty Avengers and the New Avengers worked together to fight off the threat as several of their own members became infected. They held the city together as best they could until Iron Man could develop and release a cure to the plague. Rather than arrest the New Avengers, the Mighty Avengers team ignored their presence and focused only on damage control.</p><p>Iron Man investigated the source of the symbiote bomb and traced it straight back to Dr. Doom. It did not matter whether the attack was intentional or not. The Mighty Avengers led a <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> attack on Dr. Doom in <a href=\"/latveria/4020-41031/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41031\">Latveria</a>, taking the fight straight to him in his castle. Doom was unprepared for the assault. He did not even know his biological weapon had been triggered, because he had just returned from a trip elsewhere in the timeline. When his technological defenses failed against the Mighty Avengers, he resorted to his magic and nearly had them all at his mercy. However, nothing he could do would protect him from the Sentry's sheer power. He was brutally defeated and unmasked. The Mighty Avengers brought him back to the United States to answer for his crimes.</p><h3>Secret Invasion</h3><p><b>For further details:</b> <a href=\"/secret-invasion/4045-47264/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-47264\">Secret Invasion</a></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4906070-6832135241-28403.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4906070\" data-ratio=\"0.77319587628866\" data-width=\"1940\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1940px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4906070-6832135241-28403.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4906070\"><img alt=\"The invasion\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4906070-6832135241-28403.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4906070-6832135241-28403.jpg 1940w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/4906070-6832135241-28403.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4906070-6832135241-28403.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The invasion\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4906070-6832135241-28403.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4906070-6832135241-28403.jpg 1940w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/4906070-6832135241-28403.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4906070-6832135241-28403.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The invasion</figcaption></figure><p>After weeks of paranoia over Skrulls, the alien invaders finally made their move in the final phase of their invasion plans. A Skrull ship crashed in the <a href=\"/savage-land/4020-21766/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-21766\">Savage Land</a>, setting off enough planetary alarms as it went down to alert the Mighty Avengers. The team prepared to investigated but was delayed by the New Avengers, who stole the <a href=\"/avengers-quinjet/4055-53156/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-53156\">quinjet</a> to investigate the crash site themselves rather than trust the Mighty Avengers to do it. By the time the Mighty Avengers caught up, Luke Cage and the others were already at the crashed ship. Iron Man wanted them to hold off on doing anything, but Luke still had Iron Man pegged as a Skrull and wanted answers he thought were inside the ship. What they found inside appeared to be a large group of heroes who had been abducted years ago, including another Iron Man and another Ms. Marvel.</p><p>The Skrulls' trap for both Avengers teams was sprung, and Ares called it correctly. He warned the others that this was a distraction from the true battle, and that as many of them as possible should get back to civilization. Iron Man was quickly incapacitated by a Skrull virus, and the other heroes were itching for a fight. Chaos broke out, and everyone was suddenly scattered throughout the Savage Land. Only Ms. Marvel made it out and flew straight to New York, where she engaged the army of Super-Skrulls attacking the city. Back in the Savage Land, Iron Man continued to suffer from the virus and Spider-Woman revealed herself as a Skrull to him. She tried to get him to believe that he was a sleeper Skrull agent and made all this possible, but Black Widow intervened and assured Iron Man otherwise. The paranoia and chaos in the Savage Land would have continued indefinitely had <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Mr. Fantastic</a> and <a href=\"/abigail-brand/4005-4441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4441\">Abigail Brand</a> not arrived with the means to identify the Skrulls and get the two Avengers teams to New York.</p><p>In Central Park, the Mighty Avengers gathered with the New Avengers, <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a>, the <a href=\"/young-avengers/4060-40426/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40426\">Young Avengers</a>, the <a href=\"/secret-warriors/4060-54569/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-54569\">Secret Warriors</a>, <a href=\"/bucky-barnes/4005-40470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40470\">Captain America</a> and the Thunderbolts for a climatic battle against Queen Veranke and her Skrull forces. The Skrulls had one last surprise, though. The growth serum previously given to Wasp by a Skrull posing as Hank Pym was actually a biological weapon, turning her into a living bomb that the Skrulls now triggered. They were willing to kill themselves along with the humans rather than be beaten. As Wasp grew uncontrollably and was on the verge of detonation, Thor used <a href=\"/mjolnir/4055-40971/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40971\">Mjolnir</a> to transport her to another dimension, where she could die peacefully without taking anyone with her. The tide then turned against the Skrulls, and the invasion was repelled.</p><h3>Dark Reign</h3><p><b>For further details:</b> <a href=\"/dark-reign/4045-55707/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55707\">Dark Reign</a></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6336726-7181045942-9fdb0.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6336726\" data-ratio=\"0.77\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6336726-7181045942-9fdb0.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6336726\"><img alt=\"The New Avengers vs. the Dark Avengers\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6336726-7181045942-9fdb0.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6336726-7181045942-9fdb0.jpg 500w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6336726-7181045942-9fdb0.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The New Avengers vs. the Dark Avengers\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6336726-7181045942-9fdb0.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6336726-7181045942-9fdb0.jpg 500w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6336726-7181045942-9fdb0.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The New Avengers vs. the Dark Avengers</figcaption></figure><p>After the invasion, politics kicked in and Iron Man took the fall for all of the mistakes that allowed the Skrulls to infiltrate so severely, and because <a href=\"/norman-osborn/4005-58812/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\">Norman Osborn</a> not only saved Washington D.C. but took the shot that killed Queen Veranke, he was given Iron Man's job.

Ares and the Sentry stayed on to serve under Osborn.</p><p>With Osborn in charge, the Mighty Avengers gave way to the <a href=\"/dark-avengers/4060-55990/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55990\">Dark Avengers</a>, a group consisting largely of former villains masquerading as Earth's mightiest heroes. The group included Daken (posing as Wolverine), Moonstone (posing as Ms. Marvel), Venom (posing as Spider-Man) and Bullseye (posing as Hawkeye). The roster was rounded out by former Might Avengers Sentry and Ares, as well as <a href=\"/noh-varr/4005-11565/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11565\">Marvel Boy</a> (now known as Captain Marvel).</p><h3>Earth's Mightiest</h3><p>Early into the days of Osborn's <a href=\"/dark-reign/4045-55707/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55707\">Dark Reign</a>, chaotic and unexplainable events began occurring all over the world. The seas boiled, Philadelphia overran with deadly plant life and San Francisco became encased in amber. All of it was the result of <a href=\"/modred-the-mystic/4005-13924/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13924\">Modred</a> using the <a href=\"/the-darkhold/4055-45058/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-45058\">Darkhold</a> to raise <a href=\"/chthon/4005-15683/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15683\">Chthon</a> in <a href=\"/wundagore-mountain-transia/4020-41286/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41286\">Wundagore</a>. <a href=\"/amadeus-cho/4005-43587/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43587\">Amadeus Cho</a> figured out where the source of the chaos was and, along with <a href=\"/hercules/4005-2503/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2503\">Hercules</a>, sought to pull together an Avengers team to confront it. They tracked down <a href=\"/jarvis/4005-1781/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1781\">Jarvis</a> first, because they considered him crucial to any Avengers team. In turn, Jarvis directed them to Hank Pym.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"/loki/4005-4324/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4324\">Loki</a> saw opportunity for mischief. He disguised himself as the <a href=\"/scarlet-witch/4005-1466/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\">Scarlet Witch</a> and began teleporting away specific heroes, including the <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a>, <a href=\"/usagent/4005-14992/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14992\">U.S. Agent</a>, <a href=\"/stature/4005-40516/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40516\">Stature</a> and <a href=\"/vision/4005-1504/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1504\">Vision</a>. Like Cho, Iron Man also figured out the pattern and headed for Wundagore.</p><p>Much to Pym's annoyance, the collected heroes fell under the leadership of Iron Man when they all gathered in Wundafore. However, the situation was dire and he was not inspiring much confidence by calling himself the Wasp now. Modred succeeded in raising Chthon and used the body of <a href=\"/quicksilver/4005-1467/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1467\">Quicksilver</a> as host. However, as the situation continued to escalate, it was Pym who figured out how to neutralize Chthon and pull the entity out of Quicksilver's body. Iron Man left afterward, having to deal with his own problems with Osborn. But the situation inspired Pym, and he asked the remaining heroes to join him in a new incarnation of the Mighty Avengers. The Hulk refused, as did Quicksilver. The rest agreed, and Quicksilver changed his mind upon seeing who he believed to be his sister aiding the team.</p><p>Quickly, Hank Pym took his new team on a spree of adventures, solving crises all over the world. This brought the unwelcome attention of Norman Osborn and <a href=\"/hammer/4060-56065/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56065\">H.A.M.M.E.R.</a> because it was hurting Osborn's image to have another Avengers team out there beyond his control. Pym's status as a founding Avenger also brought up questions of legitimacy when it came to which Avengers team was the real Avengers. Much of this growing conflict was due to Loki, who guided the Mighty Avengers from crisis to crisis under the guise of the Scarlet Witch.</p><p>H.A.M.M.E.R. was eventually able to locate the access door to Pym's secret lab while the team was out on another mission. Only Jocasta and Jarvis were present to deal with the H.A.M.M.E.R. agents at the door, and they were forced to detach Pym's lab from it, sending it adrift in reality. Meanwhile, Pym was approached with an offer from a global agency called <a href=\"/grampa/4060-56485/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56485\">G.R.A.M.P.A.</a> that would authorize the Avengers' activities in several states outside of Osborn's influence.</p><p>To repair his lab and save his experiments, Pym required a device <a href=\"/goliath/4005-3470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3470\">Bill Foster</a> invented. The problem was that when Foster died the device was left to <a href=\"/thing/4005-2114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2114\">Ben Grimm</a>, and Mr. Fantastic did not trust Pym with the device due to all the emotional stresses he was under. In response, Pym led his team on a raid of the <a href=\"/baxter-building/4020-41454/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41454\">Baxter Building</a> to take the device. As the Mighty Avengers and <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a> fought, Pym and Mr. Fantastic grappled over Bill Foster's device. Eventually, Pym was able to show Mr. Fantastic the experiment he was working on that he wanted so badly to save, and upon seeing the preserved body of Janet Van Dyne in the dimension Thor had sent her, Mr. Fantastic agreed to let Pym have the device.</p><h3>Unspeakable</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2010102\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101073/2010102-mighty_avengers_27.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.518\" data-width=\"1000\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101073/2010102-mighty_avengers_27.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2010102\"><img alt=\"The Unspoken\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 1000w, https://static.comicvine.com/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 632w, https://static.comicvine.com/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 421w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Unspoken\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 1000w, https://static.comicvine.com/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 632w, https://static.comicvine.com/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Unspoken</figcaption></figure><p>In China, a powerful and forgotten Inhuman king now known only as <a href=\"/the-unspoken/4005-63591/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-63591\">the Unspoken</a> sought a device known as the Slave Engine. Many years ago, he hid this holy Inhuman relic and refused to ever tell where it was. Now, he wanted to make use of it himself. The Slave Engine was capable of releasing a gas like the <a href=\"/terrigen-mists/4055-40921/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40921\">Terrigen Mists</a>, except it had the effect of devolving humans into <a href=\"/alpha-primitives/4060-55902/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55902\">Alpha Primitives</a>. The Unspoken's intent was to enslave Earth's population and win back the favor of the Inhuman people. At first, only U.S. Agent, Quicksilver and the<a href=\"/peoples-defense-force/4060-56647/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56647\">People's Defense Force</a> stood in his way. They were not enough.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hank Pym disappeared during an experiment into the <a href=\"/macroverse/4020-56470/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56470\">Macroverse</a>, and during this time, he believed <a href=\"/eternity/4005-11332/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11332\">Eternity</a> spoke to him and chose him to be the Scientist Supreme of Earth over Tony Stark and Reed Richards.</p><p>In order to combat the Unspoken, the Mighty Avengers gathered as much Avengers from other teams as they could find. Members of the New Avengers, <a href=\"/young-avengers/4060-40426/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40426\">Young Avengers</a> and <a href=\"/avengers-resistance/4060-57031/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57031\">Avengers Resistance</a> came to China to help, but many fell under the effects of the Slave Engine, becoming Alpha Primitives loyal to the Unspoken. Soon, Hank Pym joined the fight as well, and the crisis was successfully brought under control.</p><h3>Mighty No Longer</h3><p>Suspicions about the Scarlet Witch had steadily been rising, but it was not until an altercation with the Dark Avengers that the team realized what was truly going on. Loki was impersonating the Scarlet Witch. Wanting answers, Pym created the means to not only trap Loki but torture the god for answers. While being questioned, Loki confessed to manipulating the team, including posing as Eternity and naming Pym as Scientist Supreme to play on his ego. All the while, Loki sent out a call to <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a> for aid, and when Thor arrived, the god of thunder was enraged with the treatment of his half-brother. He demanded Loki's release, and the Mighty Avengers complied since many of them were also uncomfortable with the actions Pym had taken.</p><p>Adding to the growing misgivings about Pym, he requested that Loki become a member of the Mighty Avengers. This was the breaking point for the team. All of them lost what faith they had in him and left, effectively dissolving the Mighty Avengers.</p><h3><b>Siege</b></h3><p>In <a href=\"/siege/4045-55985/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55985\">Siege</a>, bringing his Dark Reign to its climax, Norman Osborn has one last objective to complete: bringing down <a href=\"/asgard/4020-40990/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40990\">Asgard</a>. Teaming up with the villain, Loki, Norman frames the Asgardian <a href=\"/volstagg/4005-3513/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3513\">Volstagg</a>, giving himself an excuse to attack. Norman then leads his \"Avengers\" on an all out assault on Asgard, and the first hero to fall in the battle is none other then Thor.</p><p>As the battle rages on, Ares learns of Norman's lies and decides to join his fellow god's into battling Osborn's forces. <a href=\"/maria-hill/4005-40824/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40824\">Maria Hill</a> then rescues Thor from Norman's men, and helps him escape back into town to heal. Back at the Avengers hideout in Brooklyn, the newly returned Steve Rogers, in uniform, rallies the New and Young Avengers along with Nick Fury and his <a href=\"/secret-warriors/4060-54569/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-54569\">Secret Warriors,</a> and they then head to Asgard. Back in Asgard, Ares has a change of heart and finds and attacks Norman, but is stopped by Sentry, who, after a short struggle rips Ares in half, killing him.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2883774\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2883774-thunderbolts__142___page_3.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5131578947368\" data-width=\"988\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 988px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2883774-thunderbolts__142___page_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2883774\"><img alt=\"Avengers vs. Thunderbolts by Wellinton Alves\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px\" data-width=\"422\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2883774-thunderbolts__142___page_3.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2883774-thunderbolts__142___page_3.jpg 988w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11/117763/2883774-thunderbolts__142___page_3.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/117763/2883774-thunderbolts__142___page_3.jpg 634w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2883774-thunderbolts__142___page_3.jpg 422w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Avengers vs. Thunderbolts by Wellinton Alves\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2883774-thunderbolts__142___page_3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2883774-thunderbolts__142___page_3.jpg 988w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11/117763/2883774-thunderbolts__142___page_3.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/117763/2883774-thunderbolts__142___page_3.jpg 634w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2883774-thunderbolts__142___page_3.jpg 422w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px\" data-width=\"422\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Avengers vs. Thunderbolts by Wellinton Alves</figcaption></figure><p>By the time Norman Osborn attacked <a href=\"/asgard/4020-40990/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40990\">Asgard</a>, the Avengers were no longer officially together, but this did not prevent Amadeus Cho from trying to get as much of the band back together as possible to aid the <a href=\"/asgardian-gods/4060-41205/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41205\">Asgardians</a>. Stature and Vision were already on their way along with the rest of the Young Avenges and others <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Steve Rogers</a> had assembled. Cho was able to hitch a ride to Asgard with U.S. Agent, and his message also reached Quicksilver.

Only with the help of Loki who begged Odin for the Norn Stones, did the Avengers gain the power of the stones. Now powered up, the Avengers took the fight straight to the Void, gaining the upper hand, but this new power-up was short lived as the Void seemly kills Loki, taking away the heroes new found power. Iron Man takes control of the H.A.M.M.E.R. Helicarrier, turning it into a giant bullet, and ramming it into the Void. The heroes find Bob begging them to kill him, but he soon reverts back into the Void, only to be finally struck down by Thor, Thor then takes the Sentry's body and throws it into the sun.</p><h3>The Heroic Age</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2831982\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2831982-siege__4___page_26.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.77061855670103\" data-width=\"1940\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1940px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2831982-siege__4___page_26.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2831982\"><img alt=\"Avengers by Olivier Coipel\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2831982-siege__4___page_26.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2831982-siege__4___page_26.jpg 1940w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11/117763/2831982-siege__4___page_26.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/117763/2831982-siege__4___page_26.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2831982-siege__4___page_26.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Avengers by Olivier Coipel\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2831982-siege__4___page_26.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2831982-siege__4___page_26.jpg 1940w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11/117763/2831982-siege__4___page_26.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/117763/2831982-siege__4___page_26.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2831982-siege__4___page_26.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Avengers by Olivier Coipel</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/the-heroic-age/4045-56023/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56023\">The Heroic Age</a>, the President gives Steve Rogers Norman Osborn's job as America's Top Cop, Steve accepts, but tells the President that he's going to do things his way.

Without hesitation, Thor lands a blow on him, and throws him off the building. The Avengers quickly go after Kang, who holds a mysterious device. It is a device that Iron Man conceived, but never got to actually create: a doomsday machine. Forced to do as Kang says, in fear he will activate it, the Avengers hear him out: according to Kang, <a href=\"/ultron/4005-2242/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2242\">Ultron</a> would slay the Avengers at some point in the future, and rule with an iron fist, before the <a href=\"/next-avengers/4060-17900/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-17900\">Avengers’ children</a> eventually stop his reign – only to start their own empire, and threaten the entire universe.

With this, they quickly learn that the time stream is in fact broken, but before they are able to act, they are attacked by Wonder Man, but he is quickly defeated.

All of a sudden, just as quick as Apocalypse and his Horsemen arrived, they disappear again into the timestream.

Meanwhile the Avengers Wolverine, Iron Man, Captain America and Noh-Varr arrive in the future in a cave in Central Park and look outside to see a gruesome all-destroying battle.

Sam Alexander, the new Nova, crash landed on earth to deliver a warning to the Avengers that the Phoenix Force is on it's way to Earth. Later the Avengers travel to Utopia and ask Cyclops to hand over Hope so they can put her in protective custody, but the latter refuses since he believes Hope will save the mutant race from extinction and orders Captain America to leave.</p><p>After a brief scuttle Captain America assembles the Avengers on Utopia and a war breaks out between the two teams. Emma Frost places Hope under the protection of the Five Lights until the matter is resolved, but Hope refuses believing she is the cause of this war and knocks out the Lights. Spider-man and Wolverine enter the compound to get her but they are immediately overwhelmed by her rising Phoenix powers.</p><p>Meanwhile Thor leads the secret Avengers in space to stop the Phoenix but they are soon defeated. The Avengers and the X-men travel around the world to search for Hope. Iron Man and Giant Man prepare a weapon to kill the Phoenix, while both teams fight on the Blue Area of the Moon; Hope is starting to lose control of the Phoenix and asks Wolverine to kill her. Iron Man, sporting a new armor, shoots the Phoenix but instead of killing it it separates it into fragments which bond with Cyclops, Emma Frost, Magik, and Colossus.</p><p>They defeat the Avengers with their new found powers and head back to earth with Hope. Now the Phoenix Five reform the world according to their will by supplying free energy, food, water, as well as ending armed conflicts around the world. The Avengers believe the power is corrupting them and got to Utopia to get Hope, when they do they are nearly beaten by Cyclops but managed to escape thanks to the Scarlet Witch. Cyclops had enough and declares that he will no longer tolerate the Avengers by saying,\"No more Avengers.\"</p><p>The X-Men begin hunting down the Avengers around the world while the latter hides and think of a counter attack. Sooner or later some members of the Avengers are captured and imprisoned by the X-Men. During a confrontation between the two teams the Scarlet Witch injures Magik while Emma Frost severely burns Hawkeye, the Five heal Hawkeye and Cyclops reprimands them for their use of excessive force, but Magik defends that they must kill the Scarlet Witch and Namor reminds him that they are at war.</p><p>Meanwhile Black Panther and Iron Man try to find a way to stop the Phoenix Five, while Hope is taken to K'un L'un for training, and to everyone's surprise it is Spider-Man who must train her. While fighting the Scarlet Witch injures Namor, furious he goes against Cyclops's orders and attacks Wakanda with the Atlanteans. After a long and arduousbattle the Avengers finally bring down Namor, but Cyclops and the rest of the Phoenix avatars arrive and a portion of Namor's Phoenix powers are absorbed and divided into the remaining avatars.</p><p>As days pass by, more and more Avengers are captured by the Phoenix Five, and Hope's training in K'un-L'un shows no results. Several X-Men feel uncomfortable about the way the Phoenix Five are treating their prisoners. Storm arrives in Wakanda in the aftermath of Namor's assault and tells Black Panther that the captured Avengers are being held prisoner in a volcano in Siberia. The Avengers then lead a rescue mission with the help of Storm and Professor X to break out their comrades but are stopped by Magik and Colossus. Spider-Man baits Magik and Colossus into taking each other out, allowing the Avengers to escape. As the Avengers arrive back in K'un-L'un, they are surprised by Cyclops, strengthened by half of Magik and Colossus's portions of the Phoenix force.</p><p>The Avengers stall Cyclops as Hope retreats to find Lei Kung, who tells her that he has one final lesson and presents Shao Lao the dragon, the source of the Iron Fist energy. Hope absorbs the dragon's energy and manages to stave off Cyclops's advance. She falls back behind the Scarlet Witch and with a combination of both their powers, Hope sends Cyclops to the Moon. On the Moon, Cyclops comes to the realization that he will need Emma Frost's power as well in order to defeat Hope. Meanwhile on Utopia, Magneto asks Professor X for his help as Emma Frost's rule becomes more tyrannical.</p><p>Cyclops then absorbs Emma Frost's power and becomes the Dark Phoenix while also killing Professor X. The X-Men and Avengers team up to stop Cyclops but even with their combined might they are no match for Scott's godly powers.

A <a href=\"/skrulls/4060-40668/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40668\"><b>Skrull</b></a> posing as <a href=\"/black-panther/4005-1477/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1477\"><b>Black Panther</b></a> easily found out information about the Avengers fighting against the Skrull army. Once the Avengers found out that a Skrull was impersonating their fellow teammate and friend, the Avengers took him down and freed the real Black Panther. <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\"><b>Iron Man</b></a> created ID cards for the Avengers so that they can have access to the mansion instead of outsiders (people outside of the team) could just walk in. Throughout the years the ID cards have gotten more advanced and are currently used by mostly all of the branching Avenging teams (e.g. <a href=\"/secret-avengers/4060-40904/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40904\"><b>Secret Avengers</b></a> ). The ID Cards were also created for the days during the superhero fight for freedom called <a href=\"/civil-war/4045-40615/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40615\"><b>Civil War</b></a> - as a reminder for heroes to keep their cards at all cost or suffer being thrown into the <a href=\"/the-negative-zone/4020-40699/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40699\"><b>Negative Zone</b></a> .</p><p>Though the ID Cards have come in handy, mostly any super powered villain could steal one from an Avenger member and use a shape-shifter to pose as that hero. So Iron Man (teamed with other genius heroes) made a card that needs the Avengers retina scanned. The look and ideal of the ID Card has changed throughout the years, but it is one of the Avengers greatest tools at keeping their secrets safe.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><p><b>Earth-2149</b></p><p>In this alternate reality, the Avengers are infected by a virus that turns everyone into a zombie who craves for flesh no matter what. The Avengers are at their mansion when a man <a href=\"/ash/4005-11302/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11302\">Ash Williams</a> breaks in and tries to warn the team of an ongoing danger.

The plot of the game changes seasonally and a \"Spec-Ops\" event will take place every month. The first season of the game takes place in the middle of a worldwide astronomical happening called , \"The Pulse\", which afterwards gave birth to a new, powerful compound called \"Iso-8\". In the second season, a mysterious group known as, \"The Circle of Eight\" are rounding up the vilest of the vile for an upcoming cataclysm.

That was the motivation that spurred him to create his \"Master Mold\", a servitor/controller that would command the many 'Sentinels' that Trask would create later. Unfortunately the A.I. it had been given, began to grow exponentially and Master Mold became sentient, and made sure his progeny acquired this ability also. Ironically, unbeknownst to Trask he had fathered two children who would grow up to become mutants: Tanya (and Lawrence) who had the ability of time travel and due to the instability of her power became lost in the timestream.</p><p>When Bolivar discovered that Lawrence was 'gifted' with precognition, he went to great lengths to create a device that would cloak his son's genetic ability (from his guardians) and hid it within an amulet, that he gave Lawrence, after Bolivar realized his son had predicted his wife's death. Trask had created humanity's guardian in <a href=\"/master-mold/4005-10254/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10254\">Master Mold</a>, but had not factored in Sentinel Logic in problem-solving, \"We were created to be the Guardians of Mankind - and to guard them properly we must RULE them completely\".</p><p>Master Mold commanded the existing Sentinels to capture their creator and return with him, So that he could commence the creation of a vast army of Sentinels with the intention of World domination. Trask, after witnessing Beast's interrogation under the Psycho-probe, realized that it was he, who had created the threat. To right His Wrong, in a attempt to destroy Master Mold, he sacrificed himself by triggering a catastrophic explosion. The X-Men barely escaped, Bolivar was found by his son, who, from that day blamed Mutants (specifically the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a> ) for his father's demise, and made it his project, to vastly improve on his father's design, initially converting the Mk I's then eventually creating the superior Mark II Sentinels. They could identify/determine a mutant's power from a distance due to an encyclopaedic database and advanced scanning equipment, and could conceive a plan to nullify/neutralize all mutant powers/attacks, and incapacitate any opponent.</p><p>Judge Chalmers (a close family friend) abhorred by Lawrence's extreme solution, (and privy to the family secret) decided to shock his young ward by snatching the amulet about his neck (That, to that day had hidden his presence from his servitors) No longer masked by the amulet, his former servitors, apprehended Trask and followed his last order as their leader, \"<b>Secure</b> All Mutants in area - - and <b>DESTROY</b> them\", Needless to say the X-Men triumphed and saved the Day. In a future confrontation with his creations, Lawrence became involved, when Quicksilver used him, to locate his sister, the Scarlet Witch, who had been abducted by Sentinels, (lead by their (unbeknownst to them) Now mutated leader, No. 2, recently returned from their aborted mission to the Sun) in their latest scheme to rid the world of Mutants. Unfortunately, He too, came to an untimely end, crushed beneath one of his creations like his father.</p><p>Even though two generations of Sentinels had failed in their objective, the technology still lived on, the US government took possession of Trask's blueprints and specs, wherein (<a href=\"/steven-lang/4005-14861/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14861\">Steven Lang</a> and later) <a href=\"/sebastian-shaw/4005-2175/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2175\">Sebastian Shaw</a> set out to build a new line of Sentinels.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Sentinels were created by <a href=\"/stan-lee/4040-40467/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\">Jack Kirby</a>.

It's Primary Objective/Directive was to protect the Trask genealogy and ensure the safety of humankind, to seek out and capture Mutants (in order to observe, examine and discover the weaknesses and strengths of their prey). It's self-diagnostic cycle accelerated causing it to evolve, and it eventually became sentient and concluded, control of Mankind (the originator of Mutantkind) was the most efficient way, and decided the expansion of the primary complement of Sentinels was the solution, (an action that had been designed to be achieved solely by it's creator) Master Mold bided it's time till their existence had been announced at a televised debate (to put it's ploy into effect) between their creator and (ironically) Professor Charles Xavier, the leading expert on Genetic mutation and (secretly) the founder of the team of Mutants tasked with the duty to protect humans (primarily from the opinionated indocile of their ilk).</p><h3>Nimrod</h3><p><i>First Appearance</i> <a href=\"/the-uncanny-x-men-raiders-of-the-lost-temple/4000-25301/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-25301\">Uncanny X-Men #191</a></p><p><a href=\"/nimrod/4005-13314/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13314\">Nimrod</a> was created in the alternate reality \"<a href=\"/days-of-future-past/4045-44425/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-44425\">Days of Future Past</a>\" and was the most advanced Sentinel of it's time.

In the movie, it is revealed that the earliest models of Sentinels were developed by Bolivar Trask during the early 1970's, but after Trask was murdered by <a href=\"/mystique/4005-1469/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1469\">Mystique</a>, the machines were upgraded by integrating the shape-shifting mutant's DNA.</p><p>By 2023, the Sentinels have wiped out most of the human race and can now adapt and counteract any mutant superpower. With the X-Men hopelessly outmatched, <a href=\"/kitty-pryde/4005-3548/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3548\">Kitty Pryde </a>sends <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine </a>back in time to prevent Trask's assassination and stop the Sentinel program from ever taking off. The young <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto</a> manages to hijack the Sentinels and uses them to attack Washington, D.C., but is stopped by Mystique, who is convinced by <a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Charles Xavier </a>to spare Trask's life. As a result, Trask is discredited and arrested for leaking military secrets, which leads to the dark, Sentinel-controlled future never coming to pass since the Sentinel project is scrapped following Trask's incarceration.</p><p>In the movie, the original 1970's Sentinels resemble more realistic versions of their comic counterparts, while the futuristic Sentinels deviate more heavily. According to designer John Myhre, this was to allow the Sentinels to change their size and shape in order to adapt to any threat. They were intended to be the closest thing to a live action version of Nimrod. The future Sentinels were strong enough to easily rival Colossus in brute strength, with 2 of them being capable of ripping him in half. They were also extremely durable, particularly against impact forces and extreme cold, all of this even without using their adaptive powers. They were also extremely agile for their size, and were capable of flying faster than the 1973 versions. Their adaptive powers worked by using mutant powers to adapt to the obstacle or threat they were facing, althrough they seemed unable to copy the powers of certain mutants. Among the powers they were able to copy were those of Colossus, Iceman, Sunspot, Rockslide and Emma Frost. They were also capable of transforming their faces into powerful laser cannons, whose energy output was so high that 3 Sentinels were capable of overloading Bishop's energy absorbing powers in seconds, causing him to explode. They could also shapeshift their arms into various weapons and tools, including pikes and drills. They were also immune to Magneto's power They were usually deployed from huge airborne dropships that looked similar to coffins, which had gunnery turrets on both sides.</p><p><b>X-Men Animated Series</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1779279\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/72848/1779279-sentinelnightree.png\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/72848/1779279-sentinelnightree.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1779279\"><img alt=\"Sentinels in X-Men The Animated Series\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/72848/1779279-sentinelnightree.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/72848/1779279-sentinelnightree.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Sentinels in X-Men The Animated Series\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/72848/1779279-sentinelnightree.png\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/72848/1779279-sentinelnightree.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sentinels in X-Men The Animated Series</figcaption></figure><p><b>For More Information: <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/x-men/17-28914/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men The Animated Series</a></b></p><p>The Sentinels were used to terminate mutants.

After Sophie's untimely death, they began calling themselves the Four-In-One. The Cuckoos blamed Emma Frost for Sophie's death, and separated themselves from her. This hurt her greatly.

Emma managed to barely hold out against this attack in her diamond form until Scott willingly showed Jean that nothing had happened. Emma was later discovered in her diamond form, shattered in pieces, having been shot by a diamond bullet while in her diamond body, which had one flaw. To help find the murderer, Sage and Bishop came to investigate. They found that Angel Salvador killed Emma, but was being mind-controlled by Esme, who was working for Xorn (Magneto). Deciding to flee, Esme told the other Cuckoos that she desired individuality and that Emma Frost did not care about them, but instead only wanted to make them like her. Bishop and Sage confronted Esme as she was leaving.

The other Cuckoos assisted the X-Men as they fought the Phoenix Force by using Cerebra to contact all of the X-Men and collecting them to channel positive thoughts and love to Jean Grey.

The three Cuckoos each handled the Phoenix's influence differently. Celeste feared the power of the Phoenix, remembering how it drove Jean Grey insane, while Phoebe embraced its destructive powers. They went to different staff separately to try to work out their feelings and their growing identities, free of their sisters. However, before the X-Men could effectively intervene, the Phoenix took over and the Cuckoos returned to <a href=\"/the-world/4020-41078/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41078\">The World</a>, the headquarters of the Weapons Plus program. Meanwhile, Esme and Sophie mysteriously revived, albeit in decaying forms, and spoke of collecting information and realizing their true mission.</p><p>The X-Men followed the Cuckoos and learned that as creations of The World, the Cuckoos have implanted nano-technology that caused them to unknowingly transmit any and all information they encountered back to The World. Thus, Esme and Sophie did not actually return to life, but were rather piloted by their nano-technological systems. In addition, Emma learnt that the Cuckoos were truly her daughters, having been cloned from her eggs, which were harvested by <a href=\"/sublime/4005-11330/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11330\">Dr. Sublime</a> while she was in a coma following a Sentinel attack years before. Sublime cloned a thousand Cuckoos, in tanks hooked up to machinery. The original five were released to infiltrate the school and transmit information. Their origins were never questioned due to a strong telepathic block placed in everyone's minds which would cause their thoughts to redirect whenever they questioned where the Cuckoos came from.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/134071-72981-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-134071\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.48\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:148.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/134071-72981-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-134071\"><img alt=\"Weapon XIV\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/77/134071-72981-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/134071-72981-stepford-cuckoos.jpg 400w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/77/134071-72981-stepford-cuckoos.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Weapon XIV\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/77/134071-72981-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/134071-72981-stepford-cuckoos.jpg 400w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/77/134071-72981-stepford-cuckoos.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Weapon XIV</figcaption></figure><p>Dr. Sublime intended the remaining Cuckoos to return and join their \"sisters\". The true purpose of the Thousand-In-One (called Weapon XIV) was to combine their minds into one immense psychic weapon and telepathically kill every mutant on the planet. By assimilating the original Cuckoos into the one, Sublime would be able to control the power of the Phoenix through his control of the Thousand-In-One. It was then revealed that every Cuckoo could also turn into a diamond form, but unlike Emma, their diamond forms were flawless. He could then use the Thousand to split the Phoenix between all of them and trap it within their diamond bodies, thus giving him further control. Mindee willingly chose to re-assimilate, but Phoebe attempted to fight her way out. The X-Men attempted to destroy Sublime. When the X-Men severed Sublime's control of the Thousand and deactivated all the Cuckoos' nano-technology (including the original three), each individual clone awoke with their own consciousness and reached out to their sisters and mother.</p><p>It was revealed that Celeste was chosen as the primary host for the Phoenix because it heard Celeste \"call\" to her, as Celeste longed to feel, to live, and to burn with life. Emma reached out to a fearful Celeste and told her that her methods of teaching - trying to make the girls cold and emotionless as a means of protecting them - was flawed and that she hoped the girls would live with passion.

The only ones spared were Celeste, Mindee and Phoebe. During the aftermath, Celeste begged the Phoenix to leave her as what it had forced her to do was too much. The Phoenix decided it wanted to stay with Celeste, so to stop it, Celeste divided her into three, and each remaining Cuckoo turned her heart into flawless organic diamond. Doing so trapped the Phoenix within them so that it could no longer wreak havoc. Unfortunately, this also caused the Cuckoos to lose their emotions forever. Thus, the Cuckoos - especially Celeste, who longed to truly live, grow, and love - sacrificed their ability to ever do so for the sake of maintaining peace. In truth, the Phoenix they encountered was merely a shard of the true Phoenix, having been shattered into billions of pieces at the end of <i>X-Men: Phoenix Endsong</i>. Despite this, that shard remained divided in three and sealed within Celeste, Mindee, and Phoebe.</p><p>These events devastated Emma, whose thousands of cloned daughters had each just begun to reach out for her with their minds when the Phoenix chose to destroy them. Emma then vowed that the Phoenix would have to contend with her if it ever returned, be it cosmic entity or in the form of Jean Grey.</p><h3>Quest for Magik</h3><p><b>For further detail see</b> <a href=\"/quest-for-magik/4045-47186/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-47186\">Quest for Magik</a></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6754/303941-178596-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-303941\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.3125\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:31.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6754/303941-178596-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-303941\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6754/303941-178596-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6754/303941-178596-stepford-cuckoos.jpg 400w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6754/303941-178596-stepford-cuckoos.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6754/303941-178596-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6754/303941-178596-stepford-cuckoos.jpg 400w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6754/303941-178596-stepford-cuckoos.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The Cuckoos helped Elixir to master biological manipulation by taking all biological and medical information from <a href=\"/beast/4005-1462/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1462\">Beast's</a> head and duplicating it in <a href=\"/elixir/4005-4552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4552\">Elixir's</a> mind.

They soon channeled their powers to Emma Frost with the help of Cerebra, in the hopes that Frost would find and destroy the psychic blockade. Emma's psyche was temporarily disconnected from her body as she fought off the psychic Skrulls. The Cuckoos followed Cyclops' orders and used their telepathy to keep Emma's autonomic functions going, thereby animating her empty body.

They explained to Rogue that she wouldn't just get the power, she'd get the perspective as well, the perspective of triangulating on people's minds. When Rogue finished with the Cuckoos' powers, they said that the silence of little or no telepathy could be deafening. They also told Scott that they didn't find anything on Cerebra.

They traveled with Emma Frost, Cyclops, Magik, Iceman, and Goldballs to Muir Island to investigate a distress call they received. They discovered the bodies of Multiple Man, writhing in agony before dying. Emma and Cyclops proceeded into the facility, where Cyclops was soon poisoned by the mist. Though he had died, Emma projected an image of Cyclops to honor his legacy. The Cuckoos were able to see this, but Emma threatened them, forcing them to keep quiet about his death. Together, Emma and the Cuckoos projected an image of Cyclops to everyone on the entire planet, delivering a speech to inform the world about the toxicity of the Terrigen Mist. The Cuckoos helped Emma destroy half of the Terrigen Mists roaming the world. After a brief conflict with the Inhuman royal family, Cyclops appeared to have been killed by Black Bolt. This was just the projection, as Cyclops had already died from the mist, but no one knew that except the Cuckoos. A truce was negotiated, and Emma agreed to give the Inhumans some time to work things out their way.</p><h3>Inhumans vs X-Men</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/6078286-screenshot%202017-10-01%20at%206.50.21%20pm%20-%20edited.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6078286\" data-ratio=\"0.60180995475113\" data-width=\"884\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 884px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/6078286-screenshot%202017-10-01%20at%206.50.21%20pm%20-%20edited.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6078286\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11119/111191377/6078286-screenshot%202017-10-01%20at%206.50.21%20pm%20-%20edited.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/6078286-screenshot%202017-10-01%20at%206.50.21%20pm%20-%20edited.png 884w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11119/111191377/6078286-screenshot%202017-10-01%20at%206.50.21%20pm%20-%20edited.png 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11119/111191377/6078286-screenshot%202017-10-01%20at%206.50.21%20pm%20-%20edited.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11119/111191377/6078286-screenshot%202017-10-01%20at%206.50.21%20pm%20-%20edited.png\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/6078286-screenshot%202017-10-01%20at%206.50.21%20pm%20-%20edited.png 884w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11119/111191377/6078286-screenshot%202017-10-01%20at%206.50.21%20pm%20-%20edited.png 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11119/111191377/6078286-screenshot%202017-10-01%20at%206.50.21%20pm%20-%20edited.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The conflict between the Inhumans and the X-Men escalated when Beast discovered that the mutants had approximately one week left to live. Emma returned to the fold with the Cuckoos, and prepared for war. The Cuckoos helped Emma throughout the conflict, and especially in the final battle when they hijacked the minds of several Inhumans, turning them against their own people. They continued to fight alongside Emma, until the climax of the battle, when Emma was revealed to have engineered the entire conflict to avenge Cyclops. It was also revealed that Black Bolt had not actually killed Cyclops, but only the projection of him created by Emma, as the Cuckoos already knew. After the conflict had subsided, Emma had gone into hiding, and the focus of the Cuckoos returned to their education.

Their telepathic powers include broadcasting and receiving thoughts, mind control, planting illusions, blasts of pure psionic energy, seeing through another person's eyes, and also are so powerful that they are one of the few people able to operate Cerebra. The Stepford Cuckoos are considered to be near Omega-level mutants, though they have never been classified as such, and since the deaths of their two sisters, have reduced in power.</p><h3>Hive Intelligence</h3><p>The Cuckoos shared mental link also bolstered their collective intelligence. This allows the Cuckoos telepathic not only to multiply by an incredibly high factor through their shared mindscape. But it also massively accelerated their brain power and analytical processing speed. Accumulatively making their intellectual prowess even greater than the sum total of each of the girls individual parts.

This may or may not be true for the Earth-616 Cuckoos.</p><h2>Former Powers</h2><h3>Phoenix Force</h3><p>In <i>X-Men: Phoenix Warsong</i>, they were the avatars of the Phoenix. During possession, they displayed new powers related to the Phoenix, such as Phoenix-granted telekinesis and fire generation. It is unlikely that they still possess these abilities, however, especially after their captured Phoenix fragments left them abruptly during the <i>Nation X</i> storyline. It should be noted that avatars of the Phoenix are normally only Omega-level mutants and that the Phoenix in question was merely a shard of the full Phoenix Force. Regardless of this, they are uniquely powerful telepaths and essential to the X-Men. Often, they maintain telepathic communication for the teams via Cerebra when Emma is occupied with other missions.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3>Earth-15104</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8134/216381-11718-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-216381\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.0448275862069\" data-width=\"290\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 290px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:104.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8134/216381-11718-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-216381\"><img alt=\"Here Comes Tomorrow.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px\" data-width=\"290\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8134/216381-11718-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8134/216381-11718-stepford-cuckoos.jpg 290w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Here Comes Tomorrow.\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8134/216381-11718-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8134/216381-11718-stepford-cuckoos.jpg 290w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px\" data-width=\"290\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Here Comes Tomorrow.</figcaption></figure><p>The Stepford Cuckoos also exist on Earth-15104, known as <a href=\"/here-comes-tomorrow/4045-41708/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-41708\">Here Comes Tomorrow</a>. In this reality, there were only three of them left - Celeste, Mindee and Phoebe - and they called themselves the Three-in-One. They also seem to have a self-destruct sequence within their consciousness, and this is the first reference to the sisters being Weapon XIV. The Three-In-One assisted the new team of X-Men in this apocalyptic future. When the Sublime-controlled Beast re-awoke and controls Jean Grey as the Phoenix, they alert the others. Sensing that the crazed Phoenix will burn away their minds, they initiate a self-destruct sequence, committing suicide.</p><h3>Earth-58163</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6754/1100246-80379_57075_stepford_cuckoos_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1100246\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5126262626263\" data-width=\"396\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 396px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6754/1100246-80379_57075_stepford_cuckoos_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1100246\"><img alt=\"House of M\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6754/1100246-80379_57075_stepford_cuckoos_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6754/1100246-80379_57075_stepford_cuckoos_super.jpg 396w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6754/1100246-80379_57075_stepford_cuckoos_super.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"House of M\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6754/1100246-80379_57075_stepford_cuckoos_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6754/1100246-80379_57075_stepford_cuckoos_super.jpg 396w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6754/1100246-80379_57075_stepford_cuckoos_super.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>House of M</figcaption></figure><p>On Earth-58163, <a href=\"/house-of-m/4045-40991/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40991\">House of M</a>, all five Cuckoos were alive and well. Sophie still seemed to be the more dominant Cuckoo and still had the urge to be a heroine. When she found out that David and Nori were going to Japan to find Nori's father (who was labeled as a human terrorist by S.H.I.E.L.D, who were also looking for him, but to put an end to him), Sophie decided that she wanted to help them and left her sisters to go to Japan.</p><p>Sophie proved to be quite an asset to the team that went to Japan (which included Prodigy, Surge, Jubilee, Dust, Wallflower and Mercury). Even though most of the human terrorists were shielded from psionic attacks, Sophie still had enough power to manipulate some of their thoughts, and make them do as she commanded. She also helped the New Mutants in a premature face-off with the Hellions, and when Quill attacked Prodigy, she commanded Quill to surrender to her, which he did. She also was able to scan minds, which was how she learned that Wallflower was really working with the people of an experiment known as 'Project Genesis' which was what the New Mutants and the human terrorists wanted to shut down.</p><p>Wallflower quickly used her pheromones to make all the parties involved (New Mutants, Hellions and the human terrorists) hate each other so much that they would fight to the death. This brawl was ended by Mercury, who was immune to Wallflower's pheromone manipulation, when she killed Wallflower. Wind Dancer of the Hellions, cleared the pheromones in the air with her wind-manipulating powers, and Sophie, knowing that the pheromones only fueled hatred that was already there, started to use her psionics to strip the hatred so there would be no more fighting. Tragically, Sophie was gunned down by a human terrorist who was immune to her psionic manipulation, as she was trying to make peace, but the gunman refused to be at peace with mutant-kind and wanted to fight them.</p><h3>Earth-91172</h3><p>On Earth-91172, a world ravaged by the Hulk, three of the Cuckoos are alive. Mindee and Esme are the Two-in-One and Sophie has broken away and developed precognitive abilities. They are members of the Next Wave of Heroes - the last heroes of Earth led by Quentin Quire. Other members are Patriot, Wiccan, Lightspeed and Speedball. Sophie dreams of a team of dimension-hopping heroes who can help them (the Exiles), which leads to Quentin trying to reach them and create a new team, the New Exiles. In this reality, Quentin and Sophie are a couple.</p><h3>X-Men: The End</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6754/187948-33144-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-187948\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.58921161825726\" data-width=\"241\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 241px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:58.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6754/187948-33144-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-187948\"><img alt=\"X-Men: The End\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px\" data-width=\"241\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6754/187948-33144-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6754/187948-33144-stepford-cuckoos.jpg 241w\"><noscript><img alt=\"X-Men: The End\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6754/187948-33144-stepford-cuckoos.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6754/187948-33144-stepford-cuckoos.jpg 241w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px\" data-width=\"241\"></noscript></a><figcaption>X-Men: The End</figcaption></figure><p>In X-Men: The End, a possible alternate future, Celeste, Mindee and Phoebe, call themselves the Spikes.

It's during this clean-up Damage Control construction worker, Rex Randolph, finds a cosmic artifact that turns him into <a href=\"/edifice-rex/4005-43354/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43354\">Edifice Rex</a>.</p><h2>Creators</h2><p>Damage Control was created by <a href=\"/dwayne-mcduffie/4040-42450/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42450\">Dwayne McDuffie</a> and <a href=\"/ernie-colon/4040-6509/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-6509\">Ernie Colon</a> and first appeared in <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/marvel-comics-presents-19-retribution-affair-part-/4000-31258/\">Marvel Comics Presents issue 19</a> (1989).</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Damage Control!</h3><p>A test of <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Doctor Doom</a>'s latest weapon invention goes wrong and turns an entire building into glass and Damage Control is called to help out. It's revealed that Doom hasn't paid his bill in over six month and after some debate, <a href=\"/albert-cleary/4005-43331/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43331\">Albert Cleary</a> is sent to collect on Doom's account. Meanwhile, <a href=\"/thing/4005-2114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2114\">Thing</a> charges into Damage Control's offices demanding to speak to someone because his insurance had told him he was no longer covered because his policy only covered the original <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a>. <a href=\"/john-porter/4005-43330/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43330\">John Porter</a> works this out by having <a href=\"/thing/4005-2114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2114\">Thing</a> growl over the phone to the insurance company and once <a href=\"/thing/4005-2114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2114\">Thing</a> pays his deductible, all is well. <a href=\"/thing/4005-2114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2114\">Thing</a> finds out that Albert went by himself to collect from Doom and he summons the rest of the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a> to rescue him. Albert turns out to not need help as he gets <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Doctor Doom</a> to write a check himself and uncovers an embezzling scheme in the process. Once the account is paid, Damage Control can deal with the glass house in the way only Damage Control can.</p><p>Head of marketing, Henry Ackerdson, comes up with a new Image Enhancement program for the firm. It includes splashy, action-filled commercials featuring Fix-It Man, Fix-It Girl and Fluppy, the dog. His plan also includes uniforms for all employees and the drilling of a tunnel from Damage Control headquarters to their Warehouse in New Jersey. Ackerdson gives the tunnel digging crew from Stark Enterprises the wrong coordinates and sends them drilling under the Hudson river which causes the tunnel to start to flood. <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man</a> saves the day by placing a big metal plate at the bottom of the river to stop the flooding. The warehouse is destroyed however. <a href=\"/anne-marie-hoag/4005-43305/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43305\">Anne-Marie Hoag</a> cancels the Image Enhancement program and makes Henry clean up the mess where the warehouse used to be.</p><p>As part of the <a href=\"/inferno/4045-41408/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-41408\">Inferno</a> event, Damage Control is asked by the county to investigate a series robberies of building supplies at construction sites and lumber yards and the team winds up at <a href=\"/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/4020-41138/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41138\">Xavier Institute for Higher Learning</a> which is now a pile of rubble. Turns out some members of Damage Control had been there before to do some repair work and unwittingly unleashed a pack of robot clowns on the mansion. <a href=\"/colossus/4005-1460/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1460\">Colossus</a>, <a href=\"/storm/4005-1444/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1444\">Storm</a>, <a href=\"/kitty-pryde/4005-3548/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3548\">Kitty Pryde</a>, <a href=\"/kitty-pryde/4005-3548/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3548\">Kitty Pryde</a> and <a href=\"/nightcrawler/4005-1461/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1461\">Nightcrawler</a> help round them up. Back in the present, the team learns that the <a href=\"/danger-room/4020-41918/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41918\">Danger Room</a> is trying to rebuild the destroyed building and is responsible for the thefts. Damage Control shuts down the building's power and returns the stolen materials.</p><h3>Round Two</h3><p><b>\"After the earth-shattering conclusion...Once justice is served...When at the last possible moment, the world is again saved from the very brink of destruction...It's time to pick up the pieces...DAMAGE CONTROL!\"</b></p><p>When we next see Damage Control it's smack in the middle of the <a href=\"/acts-of-vengeance/4045-41931/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-41931\">Acts of Vengeance</a> storyline and the team is at the base of one of the support towers of the Brooklyn Bridge. The support has been destroyed and the only one keeping the whole bridge from tumbling to ruins is <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a> who's hoping DC can come up with a solution quick. Meanwhile back at Damage Control HQ, it is <a href=\"/bart-rozum/4005-43336/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43336\">Bart Rozum</a>'s last day and receptionist <a href=\"/anne/4005-43306/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43306\">Anne</a> gives him a heck of a going away present. Elsewhere in the building, <a href=\"/anne-marie-hoag/4005-43305/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43305\">Anne-Marie Hoag</a> gets a phone call from President <a href=\"/george-bush/4005-28108/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28108\">George Bush</a> asking her to join the Commission On Superhuman Activities.

Soon <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a> arrives at The Vault to rescue our team and put the criminals back behind bars. Arriving back in New York, John and the rest of the team find out about the sale of Damage Control and find that CarltonCo has done a little work on the Damage Control Headquarters.</p><p>Following the <a href=\"/kingpin/4005-1483/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1483\">Kingpin</a>'s trail of money leads the <a href=\"/punisher/4005-1525/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1525\">Punisher</a> to Damage Control's newly redesigned headquarters. He busts in, guns drawn, only to be told to take a number and wait to be served.

Meanwhile, <a href=\"/albert-cleary/4005-43331/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43331\">Albert Cleary</a> discovers something strange in CarltonCo's reorganization plan for Damage Control and because of it <a href=\"/gene-strausser/4005-43334/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43334\">Gene Strausser</a> is fired. He vows revenge on Damage Control. <a href=\"/bart-rozum/4005-43336/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43336\">Bart Rozum</a> is promote to assistant and his first action is to hire a new intern in the form of <a href=\"/robbie-baldwin/4005-2104/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2104\">Robbie Baldwin</a>. The <a href=\"/punisher/4005-1525/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1525\">Punisher</a> tracks <a href=\"/robin-chapel/4005-43307/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43307\">Robin Chapel</a> to her home but some quick thinking prevents him from causing any harm. Another part of the new business plan for Damage Control is not to honor the worker's negotiated contract which leads <a href=\"/lenny-ballinger/4005-43333/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43333\">Lenny Ballinger</a> to call a strike!</p><p>With Damage Control employees on strike, the destruction in the city is mounting.

Meanwhile, <a href=\"/rob-washington/4005-43335/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43335\">Rob Washington</a> is summed to a mysterious warehouse where he's offered a powerful battlesuit to extract his vengeance on the city in return for helping someone with their vengeance. Damage Control. John and Robin call in the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a> to help them repair buildings all over town. While fixing the <a href=\"/daily-bugle/4060-40822/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40822\">Daily Bugle</a> building which had been knocked off it's foundation, <a href=\"/she-hulk/4005-1449/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1449\">She-Hulk</a> is attacked by two men in battlesuits. <a href=\"/robbie-baldwin/4005-2104/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2104\">Robbie Baldwin</a> as Speedball comes to save the day and it is revealed that the mastermind behind the battlesuits is none other than <a href=\"/gene-strausser/4005-43334/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43334\">Gene Strausser</a>. By the end of the day, <a href=\"/gene-strausser/4005-43334/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43334\">Gene Strausser</a> is in jail, The <a href=\"/daily-bugle/4060-40822/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40822\">Daily Bugle</a> is on it's side, the <a href=\"/avengers-mansion/4020-41036/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41036\">Avengers Mansion</a> is back underwate and the strike is still ongoing with no end in sight! <a href=\"/robin-chapel/4005-43307/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43307\">Robin Chapel</a> calls <a href=\"/anne-marie-hoag/4005-43305/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43305\">Anne-Marie Hoag</a> for guidance, but is told she has other matters to discuss.

Ray Lippert warns Robin and John that CarltonCo is willing to gut Damage Control to raise cash. Robin talks Lenny into getting the Damage Control crew to put off the strike for an afternoon to save some folks trapped in a collapsed building. <a href=\"/nick-fury/4005-3202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3202\">Nick Fury</a> arrives with a newly released <a href=\"/gene-strausser/4005-43334/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43334\">Gene Strausser</a>, who it turns out used to work for <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">SHIELD</a> and is truly sorry for the crimes he committed. Gene has an idea to stabilize the building from the inside. Meanwhile, Fury, Hoag and Cleary march into Mr. Souris' office to attempt the hostile takeover. Turns out Souris had used a loan from <a href=\"/kingpin/4005-1483/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1483\">Kingpin</a> to purchase Damage Control. Cleary uses this information to make Souris agree to sell Damage Control back to Anne-Marie using money borrowed from Fury. Robin meets with <a href=\"/kingpin/4005-1483/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1483\">Kingpin</a> to inform him that his dealings with Damage Control are now over. Hoag restores all Damage Control employees pay raises and the strike is over and the people in the collapsing building are saved. To wrap up the day, <a href=\"/john-porter/4005-43330/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43330\">John Porter</a> restores Damage Control headquarters to it's original form. Anne-Marie heads back off to Washington, D.C. and it's business as usual at Damage Control.</p><h3>Civil War</h3><p>While tracking down <a href=\"/nitro/4005-3160/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3160\">Nitro</a> during the <a href=\"/civil-war/4045-40615/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40615\">Civil War</a> event, <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a> finds out that when <a href=\"/nitro/4005-3160/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3160\">Nitro</a> exploded in Stamford (the event that triggered the <a href=\"/civil-war/4045-40615/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40615\">Civil War</a>) he was hopped up on <a href=\"/mutant-growth-hormone/4015-42280/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-42280\">Mutant Growth Hormone</a> given to him by <a href=\"/walter-declun/4005-43751/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43751\">Walter Declun</a>, CEO of Damage Control, Inc.

To that end, a Search-And_Rescue Branch of Damage Control was created. The purpose of the team is to head into superhero battle damaged areas immediately after or shortly before the end of any battle to assist in the search and rescue of any civilians who may be trapped or injured in the rubble. <a href=\"/lenny-ballinger/4005-43333/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43333\">Lenny Ballinger</a> is leader of this new branch.

    "description": "<h2><b>Origin</b></h2><h3>Queen</h3><p>The Brood's civilization is based on insect societies such as the bees or ants consisting of a Hive-like lair. All Brood civilizations share strong telepathic bonds with their <a href=\"/brood-queen/4005-14746/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14746\">Queens</a>, thus predicting no rebellions occurring against the Queens. The Broodlings do all the work and have an undying allegiance to their Queen, however each Queen do not share in a common interest.</p><h3>Subspecies</h3><p>There are a few different types of Brood. Starting with the Broodlings who are brown in color and have known to have transparent wings. Next up is the Queen, which is also brown in colour and have no wings. They give out the orders to the Broodlings to fulfill. The second last are referred to as \"the Pure-Borns\", they are the firstborn offspring which have had no exposure to other races, they are green in color and rather large.</p><p>Lastly, the <a href=\"/brood-empress/4005-42767/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42767\">Empress Brood</a> which is also green in colour and extremely large, they are the supreme rulers of the Brood. Recently <a href=\"/phyla/4005-40922/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40922\">Phyla-Vell</a> (the new Quasar) and <a href=\"/moondragon/4005-7214/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7214\">Moondragon</a> encountered and fought a newly discovered strain of the Brood species above the planet Dlaw-Neurg during the events of <a href=\"/annihilation-conquest/4045-44982/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-44982\">Annihilation: Conquest</a>. Unlike its brethren the Brood had no eyes, a brown-colored heavily armored exoskeleton and silver-colored wings.</p><p>The Brood also possessed the ability to breath in space and was at the very least three times the size of a full-grown Brood Empress. The creature, as far as anyone can tell, was little more than a feral beast and was not raised in a Hive-mind culture like its cousins. Moondragon later deducted that the Brood (along with a sand-dwelling member of a previously undiscovered gargantuan insectoid species) were the guardians of a deserted palace <a href=\"/adam-warlock/4005-6805/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6805\">Adam Warlock</a> once lived in sitting in the sand dunes of Dlaw-Neurg and therefore were not actually natives of Dlaw-Neurg leaving the Brood's true origins open to speculation.</p><p>Recently, an unknown alien adversary of Kitty Pryde secretly infected her with an airborne virus that impregnated her with a microscopic Brood egg-sac, which made her body grow into that of a pregnant woman in her ninth month within a span of a few hours. It should be noted that these micro-Brood have been engineered to grow by consuming every last cell of their host from the inside-out and therefore must be removed before the Brood have a chance to grow out of control.</p><h3>Evolution</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2996556\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/110802/2996556-brood%20early%20form.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.1913043478261\" data-width=\"460\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 460px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:119.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/110802/2996556-brood%20early%20form.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2996556\"><img alt=\"Original form of the Brood\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/110802/2996556-brood%20early%20form.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/110802/2996556-brood%20early%20form.jpg 460w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 537px) 100vw, 537px\" data-width=\"537\"></a><figcaption>Original form of the Brood</figcaption></figure><p>Originally, the Brood had a much softer, docile form. Having traveled to the past, <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a> came across one in a <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> research facility. Rescuing the creature from his confinement, it attacked Wolverine by trying to put a Brood embryo inside him. Wolverine countered by stabbing himself in the abdomen where the embryo was. The embryo died and the creature tried to attack him physically. Wolverine slew it with his adamantium claws. Coming across a monitor, Wolverine saw that the creature was part of a hive which adapted itself according to the damage the creature had sustained. It developed an exoskeleton and expanded its teeth and jaws. Wolverine realized he was reponsible for the evolution of the Brood into the savage creatures they were today.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Brood was created by <a href=\"/chris-claremont/4040-40468/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40468\">Chris Claremont</a>, <a href=\"/dave-cockrum/4040-4447/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-4447\">Dave Cockrum</a> and <a href=\"/bob-wiacek/4040-3271/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-3271\">Bob Wiacek</a> in 1982 and first appeared in <a href=\"/the-uncanny-x-men/4050-3092/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3092\">Uncanny X-Men</a> # 155.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Brood Saga</h3><p><a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Xavier</a> and the X-Men are on a <a href=\"/shiar/4060-55854/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55854\">Shi'ar</a> spaceship led by <a href=\"/lord-samedar/4005-21758/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21758\">Lord Samedar</a> and <a href=\"/araki/4005-11318/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11318\">Araki</a>. They tell the X-Men about <a href=\"/lilandra/4005-6144/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6144\">Lilandra's</a> kidnapping and their plan to invade Earth. The X-Men are opposed of course, so they head back to Earth and get <a href=\"/jarvis/4005-1781/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1781\">Jarvis</a> and <a href=\"/tigra/4005-21188/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21188\">Tigra</a> to help. <a href=\"/deathbird/4005-6089/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6089\">Deathbird</a> and the Brood attack <a href=\"/corsair/4005-7591/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7591\">Corsair</a> and <a href=\"/storm/4005-1444/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1444\">Storm</a>. The rest of the X-Men arrive to help them defeat the Brood, but Deathbird escapes and holds Xavier against his will.</p><p>All of the X-Men were infected by the Brood, except <a href=\"/carol-danvers/4005-21561/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21561\">Carol Danvers</a>. <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine's</a> healing factor saved himself by purging the virus. He saved the rest of the X-Men except for <a href=\"/fang/4005-6090/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6090\">Fang</a> who became a Brood Warrior. While the X-Men leave, the <a href=\"/brood-queen/4005-14746/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14746\">Brood Queen</a> realizes this and instructs the Queen embryo inside <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops</a> to stop them. They find a dead <a href=\"/acanti/4005-23105/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23105\">Acanti</a> prophet and recover the \"Soul\" inside of a crystalline object in his brain. The Brood find the X-Men and defeat them while they mutate into the Brood themselves. The Soul starts to get corrupted as well, and Wolverine tries to stop his teammates. Carol arrives and has a new appearance due to the Brood experimenting on her, and she releases the Soul. It cures the X-Men, crystallizes the Brood Queen, and destroys the Broodworld. X-Men, Lilandra and <a href=\"/lockheed/4005-4444/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4444\">Lockheed</a> escape, as well as some of the Brood escaping from the exploding planet.</p><p>One notable aspect of this story-line is when Storm is infected by the brood and heals herself by jettisoning into outer-space and becoming one with an Acanti being.</p><h3>Broodfall</h3><p>A Brood ship crashes to earth in the New Mexico desert. When a group of bystanders go to the crash site a sleizoids attack and kills most of them before it steals the identity of the last survivor. The man was a parametric, so the Brood uses this to infect dying mutants that he comes across during his job, therfore building a army of Brood that posses super powers.</p><p>The X-Men sense their presence and go looking for them. They find the man who was originally infected but he fight off the X-Men. He leads them to a ally where they're attacked by a large group of Brood. The X-Men manage to fight off the group of Aliens, killing them one by one until finally killing their leader.</p><h3>Infiltrating the Assassins Guild</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11125/111253019/5311888-20160709_123206.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5311888\" data-ratio=\"0.9798149705635\" data-width=\"1189\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1189px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:98.0%\" href=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11125/111253019/5311888-20160709_123206.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5311888\"><img alt=\"Gambit, Ghost Rider, and Wolverine vs The Brood\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11125/111253019/5311888-20160709_123206.png\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11125/111253019/5311888-20160709_123206.png 1189w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11125/111253019/5311888-20160709_123206.png 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11125/111253019/5311888-20160709_123206.png 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11125/111253019/5311888-20160709_123206.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Gambit, Ghost Rider, and Wolverine vs The Brood</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/gambit/4005-1499/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1499\">Gambit</a>'s wife, <a href=\"/bella-donna/4005-7896/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7896\">Belladonna</a>, arrives at the X-Men's mansion and tells them about a war between her's and Gambit's guilds.

The test subjects were policed by an adaptive robot enforcer, called <a href=\"/shiva/4005-15390/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15390\">Shiva</a>, should any of the agents go rogue. What the Weapon X scientists did not foresee is that the experimentation on Wolverine would cause him to go on a murderous rampage, which allowed the escape of the other test subjects, and caused the deaths of the Professor and Dale Rice, among dozens of other members of Weapon X staff, both scientists and military.</p><h3>The Facility</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/76155-132004-x-23.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-76155\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/76155-132004-x-23.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-76155\"><img alt=\"X-23\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/76155-132004-x-23.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/76155-132004-x-23.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>X-23</figcaption></figure><p>Weapon X was temporarily shut down, but eventually was reinstated.

Weapon X used Logan's DNA in order to endow its agents with healing powers. The batch produced many additional failures, which were sent to a facility for dissection to determine the cause of their failures.</p><p>These rejects were freed by <a href=\"/deadpool/4005-7606/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7606\">Deadpool</a> when he escaped from the facility.

Unlike the previous two installments of Weapon X, the third Project was completely U.S.-based and focused not only on the creation of living weapons, but also on the ultimate goal of Colcord, the creation of death camps. The Director initially uses Weapon X as his personal strike force to exact revenge against Wolverine. He soon begins utilizing its resources for the capturing and imprisonment of mutants in the secret government death camp called <a href=\"/neverland/4020-55994/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55994\">Neverland</a>. Mutants who are not suitable to be used as military weapons would be executed, while those that are suitable are given the choice to join Weapon X or die.</p><p>A number of mutants, such as <a href=\"/cecilia-reyes/4005-14177/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14177\">Cecilia Reyes</a>, <a href=\"/maggott/4005-15072/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15072\">Maggott</a>, <a href=\"/ape/4005-13368/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13368\">Ape</a>, <a href=\"/tar-baby/4005-14553/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14553\">Tarbaby</a>, <a href=\"/leech/4005-3193/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3193\">Leech</a> and many others were arrested by Weapon X's agents and sent to Neverland. Those mutants deemed useless to the project were killed in gas chambers, while others were brainwashed to become Weapon X operatives. The organs of the executed prisoners were then sent to the <a href=\"/u-men/4060-47994/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47994\">U-Men</a>. The agents of the third Weapon X were <a href=\"/agent-brent-jackson/4005-15622/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15622\">Agent Brent Jackson</a> a former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent; Sabretooth, who was given new adamantium implants; the shapeshifter <a href=\"/copycat/4005-13311/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13311\">Copycat</a>, Deadpool, and <a href=\"/mauvais/4005-15624/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15624\">Mauvais</a>.</p><p>Later on, Deadpool went rogue and new operatives were recruited into Weapon X, many of whom had their powers enhanced or were brainwashed into servitude. Maverick was saved from certain death and his powers were enhanced with the purpose of assassinating Wolverine, thus Agent Zero was created. Former member of <a href=\"/alpha-flight/4060-14616/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-14616\">Alpha Flight</a> <a href=\"/wild-child/4005-9476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9476\">Wildchild</a> was brainwashed and further mutated into a Nosferatu-like feral humanoid. Former mutant terrorist Marrow had her powers set to a controllable level, restoring the young woman's natural beauty. <a href=\"/sauron/4005-3180/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3180\">Sauron</a>'s personality was merged with that of his Karl Lykos self and his energy-draining powers enhanced so he could fire energy blasts. Garrison Kane was further transformed into a cybernetic being.</p><p>Aurora was kidnapped and brainwashed, like <a href=\"/madison-jeffries/4005-24399/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24399\">Madison Jeffries</a>, who was extracted from the terrorist group known as the Zodiac and used to create hundreds of Boxbots loyal to Weapon X to serve as guards at Neverland. Washout had his powers enhanced, though at a heavy cost. Each usage of his powers endangered his life and eventually, he dies trying to kill Colcord. <a href=\"/mesmero/4005-5065/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5065\">Mesmero</a> joins willingly, while <a href=\"/reaper/4005-10317/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10317\">Reaper</a> and <a href=\"/wildside/4005-14842/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14842\">Wildside</a>, former members of the Mutant Liberation Front, became agents of the program in exchange for their lives. The psychic mutant Jack-in-the-Box joins after his legs and arms were amputated. He becomes a living polygraph.</p><p>Unbeknown to all, except Sabretooth, Mister Sinister was disguised as the head scientist at the Neverland facility, Doctor Robert Windsor. As Windsor, Sinister supposedly helped some mutants escape from Neverland, but he was only taking them to his own secret labs. After some time, Brent Jackson, the only human officially on the team, took over as Director, during a mutiny by the team in conjunction with an attack by mutants from the Underground. Cable led this group, in a mission to destroy Weapon X and expose its existence and its human rights violations. Washout and Garrison Kane died in the event, while Sabretooth was washed away into the sewers after a battle with Marrow.</p><p>Marrow used the battle to escape from Weapon X, eventually taking over the Mutant Underground, now reformed as the third incarnation of Gene Nation. Colcord fled Weapon X, with the always loyal Jeffries, and Aurora as well. Director Brent Jackson's team consisted of Wildchild, Sauron, Agent Zero, Mesmero, Jack-in-the-Box, and newly recruited Chamber, whose face was restored by the program's scientists.</p><p>Chamber was originally a double agent working for the X-Men, but was subsequently brainwashed into Jackson's service. Mister Sinister, under the alias of Dr. Windsor, remains at Weapon X. At some point, Jackson's team fought with Colcord's Boxbots. Colcord regains control of Weapon X. A person claiming to be Chamber has joined a superhero team known as Excelsior, but that person turned out to be an impostor. Following M-Day, both Chamber and Mesmero are rendered powerless.</p><p>Neverland is shut down and the prisoners, either powered or depowered, are executed by hosts of Boxbots. Records of the massive executions are discovered by Beast in the Endangered Species storyline, which also hints that some of the bodies of the prisoners executed prior to M-Day were sent to Ord and used in the research to develop the cure for mutation.</p><h3>Weapons of Mutant Destruction</h3><p>Under the direction of Reverend <a href=\"/william-stryker/4005-40564/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40564\">William Stryker</a>, a new Weapon X program emerged, which focused on the creation of undetectable killer cyborgs that could eventually eradicate mutantkind. These cyborgs were created from regular humans Stryker lured into his cause. As part of the process to refine their cyborgs, Weapon X targeted several mutants with special abilities of their interest, namely Logan, Sabretooth, <a href=\"/warpath/4005-2158/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2158\">Warpath</a>, <a href=\"/domino/4005-2161/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2161\">Domino</a> and <a href=\"/lady-deathstrike/4005-8470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8470\">Lady Deathstrike</a>.</p><h2>Alternate Versions</h2><h3>Age of Apocalypse</h3><p>Logan uses the name Weapon X instead of Wolverine. Additionally, Deadpool didn't receive his healing factor from Weapon X, but from Apocalypse.</p>",

Many of the characters that make up the Imperial Guard are in fact loosely based on many of the characters that make up DC Comics Legion of Superheroes. <a href=\"/scintilla/4005-41010/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41010\">Scintilla</a> for example bearing resemblance to <a href=\"/shrinking-violet/4005-12835/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12835\">Shrinking Violet</a>, <a href=\"/hobgoblin/4005-26374/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26374\">Hobgoblin</a> based on <a href=\"/chameleon-boy/4005-5945/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5945\">Chameleon Boy</a>, <a href=\"/astra/4005-13339/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13339\">Astra</a> based on <a href=\"/phantom-girl/4005-1257/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1257\">Phantom Girl</a>, and <a href=\"/fang/4005-6090/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6090\">Fang</a> based on <a href=\"/timber-wolf/4005-3619/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3619\">Timber Wolf</a>, among many other parallels.  During an early appearance, Wolverine battles (and defeats) Fang, stealing his costume; this battle may have been inspired as a nod to fan speculation about a battle between Wolverine and Timber Wolf.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Guard Shattered</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">During a fight with <a href=\"/vulcan/4005-21233/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21233\">Vulcan</a> the Imperial Guard suffered many casualties. Those who died in the fight were: Smasher, Hobgoblin, Cosmos, Neutron, Titan, and Impulse. Oracle and Nightshade were severely injured but they may have survived the battle. Gladiator, Scintilla, Manta, Earthquake, Mentor, and Flashfire survived the battle. Recently Vulcan formed a new <a href=\"/praetorians/4060-56912/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56912\">Imperial Guard</a> using the five most dangerous criminals the Shi'ar Empire has ever captured. They are: <a href=\"/xenith/4005-6140/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6140\">Xenith</a>, <a href=\"/pnzo/4005-59510/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59510\">Pn'Zo</a>, <a href=\"/hodinn/4005-59512/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59512\">Hodinn</a>, <a href=\"/uncreated/4005-14855/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14855\">Uncreated</a> and <a href=\"/zzzxx/4005-59546/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59546\">ZZZXX</a>.</p><h3>War of Kings</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Shi'ar went to war with the <a href=\"/kree/4060-7588/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-7588\">Kree</a>, who were joined by the <a href=\"/inhumans/4060-11427/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-11427\">Inhumans</a>. In a battle between Vulcan and <a href=\"/black-bolt/4005-4329/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4329\">Black Bolt</a>, both seemed to be killed. In the aftermath, the Kree, lead by the Inhumans, were the victors. Gladiator became the new Majestor of the Shi'ar with the Inhumans as their overlords. A peace is trying to be formed between the Shi'ar and the Kree.</p><h3>Realm of Kings</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Guard is originally dispatched to the planet Izumbardi, location of the production facilities for the Shi'ar Imperiums finest fleet. After the war with the Inumans, Izumbardi has become disheartened with the entire situation, and has decided to break off rather then remain under Shi'ar rule. This however is unacceptable to the Shi'ar, and as the apparent ruler of the planet is giving his declaration of independence, a scout reports to him that something is coming. It's the Imperial Guard, with guns blazing.</p><figure style=\"width: 688px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/1005085-prv3685_pg1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1005085\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.5174418604651\" data-width=\"688\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/1005085-prv3685_pg1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1005085\"><img alt=\"The Imperial Guard assaults Imzumbard\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/77/1005085-prv3685_pg1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/1005085-prv3685_pg1.jpg 688w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/77/1005085-prv3685_pg1.jpg 632w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-width=\"632\"></a><figcaption>The Imperial Guard assaults Imzumbard</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">But watching the Guard from a command center, Gladiator is finding it hard not to be out in the field again. He knows that as Majestor of the Imperium, he can't aid them in any sort of official capacity, as it would be frowned upon my members of the Shi'ar governing body. But old habits die hard, and as the guard is encountering some major resistance, it's Kallark the turns the tide and saves the day once again. Later as Kallark is receiving reports from the Shi'ar imperial flagship, one of his councilors berates him for taking such action, stating that it's a matter of image. Councilor Araki is dismissed, only to return to a room where the real councilor Araki is being held in a stasis field, as the imposter councilor reveals himself to be the infamous member of the Raptor Society, Talon. Later as the Guard are celebrating their victory, a small scuffle breaks out over whether Gladiator is actually the right person to lead the Imperium. But it's quickly interrupted by the new Praetor Mentor with a message that Gladiator requires them for a briefing, as they'd just volunteered themselves for a mission to the fault. And since the Imperiums fleet is stretched thin, Gladiator has acquired them a special transport team - <a href=\"/starjammers/4060-14871/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-14871\">The Starjammers</a>.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">At the fault, the Guard and the Starjammers are assaulted by a massive bio-organic ship, and consumed. The vessel is essentially helpless and as <a href=\"/chod/4005-40789/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40789\">Ch'od</a> and Mentor begin repairs on the ship, it's the Guards mission to defend it from alien microbes intent on beginning the digestion process of they're fleshy prison. As Fang, Manta, and Hussar are busy repairing the hull, the exploration team of Flashfire, the new Smasher, and Oracle are returning with enemies on their tail. They're saved as Flashfire returns to cook the microbes alive, and repairs are finished on the ship as they blast they're way out of the belly of the beast. But as they continue their exploration, they find drifting in space the Earth hero <a href=\"/quasar/4005-3319/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3319\">Quasar</a>, badly damaged and running from none other then monsters of the <a href=\"/the-cancerverse/4020-56640/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56640\">Cancerverse</a>.</p><figure style=\"width: 960px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43510/1059062-ryut006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1059062\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.94166666666667\" data-width=\"960\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:94.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43510/1059062-ryut006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1059062\"><img alt=\"The horrors of the Cancerverse\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/43510/1059062-ryut006.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43510/1059062-ryut006.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/43510/1059062-ryut006.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>The horrors of the Cancerverse</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Back on the throne world, Gladiator is saved by the figurative bell, as an attendant draws him from what looks to be an incredibly boring meeting. The M'Kraan Crystal is behaving strangely with power fluctuations, and as Gladiator approaches it, the quantum energies seem to recognize him. Gladiator touches the crystal is is given a mental communication from the Guardsman Oracle who's using Quasar to channel. The message is dire. There's danger at the fault, and the Guard is requesting massive assistance. But Oracle and Quasar can't hold the message for long, Gladiator wishes to go immediately, and even as the true Councilor Araki warns him about this decision, Gladiator can't stand to let his former comrades simply give up their lives in his service.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Meanwhile back at the Starjammers ship, the Guard is forming a wall of debris and Warstar is laying down a minefield for defense against the inhabitants of the Cancerverse coming to assault them. As the first of the defenses are tripped, Ch'od angrily messages Mentor. Someones sabotaged the ship by removing the Hypderdrive Capacitor. And the only suspect? The newest Smasher, who's on his first tour. As the members of the Guard and the Starjammers confront him, Plutonia grabs some amulets he had behind his back, and the new Smashers disguise is ruined. It's once again, Talon of the Society of Raptors. Talon says that he was only trying to help, and that if the amulets are returned, he can create two new raptors and boost the firepower of the Guard immensely.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Back outside, the Cancerverse inhabitants are attacking, but there's something oddly familiar about them. They all resemble members of the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a>, from <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a>, to <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops</a>, and even <a href=\"/storm/4005-1444/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1444\">Storm</a>. A battle ensues, and the Cancerverse's <a href=\"/nightcrawler/4005-1461/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1461\">Nightcrawler</a> manages to kill Starbolt. It's revealed that the attack is being orchestrated by the Cancerverses version of <a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Xavier</a> as some sort of <a href=\"/cerebro/4055-15073/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-15073\">Cerebro</a> Ship. As things are looking dire for the guard outside, just as Neutron is about to be devoured, something bursts through one of the flesh ships and kills it. Gladiator had joined the battle, bringing along more members of the guard, and using the M'KRaan crystal to transport them all to the fault to aid the rest of the Guard. With Gladiators arrival, the tide of the battle is quickly beginning to shift, but unfortunately, the Guardman Neutron is also killed in battle. Gladiator arrives at the ship for the briefing and is informed of the situation. Like the others, he's incredibly unhappy with Talons presence, but Talon manages to convince them that he can help. He simply needs two volunteers to become Raptors temporarily. So Mentor and Plutonia volunteer, and together with Quasar, the Raptors, and Gladiator, they lead the assault on the inhabitants of the Cancerverse attacking them. When Gladiator feels it's time to withdraw and return to the Imperium, Quasar points out that the enemy seems to be falling back - on orders from the Xavier ship who lets out a massive psychic attack. The Starjammers manage to destroy it, and return to the Imperium. Later, Kallark reports to the Inhuman queen <a href=\"/medusa/4005-4327/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4327\">Medusa</a> to explain about what happened at the fault. He warns them of what's coming, and everyone agrees that now more then ever, the Kree and the Shi'ar must be allies.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3>Earth 295 - Age of Apocalypse</h3><figure style=\"width: 778px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5774/1770404-imperial_guard_aoa.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1770404\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.83419023136247\" data-width=\"778\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:83.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5774/1770404-imperial_guard_aoa.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1770404\"><img alt=\"AOA\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5774/1770404-imperial_guard_aoa.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5774/1770404-imperial_guard_aoa.jpg 778w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5774/1770404-imperial_guard_aoa.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"AOA\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5774/1770404-imperial_guard_aoa.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5774/1770404-imperial_guard_aoa.jpg 778w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5774/1770404-imperial_guard_aoa.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>AOA</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After the mentally imbalanced son of Charles Xavier travels back in time, to kill Magneto, he unwittingly creates a new reality in which Apocalypse rules the Earth.

    "description": "<h2>Origins of the Scrier </h2> <p>Scrier is a seemingly ancient cult based on an ancient being of great power that may or may not have existed also named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-64854\" href=\"/scrier/4005-64854/\"> Scrier</a>. The Brotherhood of Scrier all wear identical costumes and masks. Together they are dedicated to obtaining more power.  <br />  </p> <h2>Enter: Norman Osborn</h2> <p>While seemingly mystical in nature and power like the being they model themselves after, in reality, their \"powers\" stem from sophisticated technology created by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-31354\" href=\"/professor-mendel-stromm/4005-31354/\"> Mendel Stromm </a>at the behest of<a data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\" href=\"/norman-osborn/4005-58812/\">  Norman Osborn</a>. Norman Osborn joined  the cult while hiding in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56099\" href=\"/europe/4020-56099/\"> Europe</a> following his <a data-ref-id=\"4045-43220\" href=\"/the-death-of-gwen-stacy/4045-43220/\"> \"death\"</a> and eventually rose to the head of the organization after disposing of the cult's head Scrier. Still believed to be dead, Osborn used the Scrier cult as his personal eyes and ears for years, as well as his personal minions to further his own goals.  <br /> <br />It was Osborn who instructed a Scrier to bring tissue samples of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\" href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\"> Peter Parker </a>and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1480\" href=\"/gwen-stacy/4005-1480/\"> Gwen Stacy </a>to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10974\" href=\"/jackal/4005-10974/\"> Miles Warren </a>in ordered to be cloned for Warren's own twisted ends, which Osborn would later use for his own purposes. Osborn also used a Scrier to befriend a mutant who could also alter people's perceptions named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-15469\" href=\"/judas-traveller/4005-15469/\"> Judas Traveller </a>so that Osborn could use Traveller as a pawn against Spider-Man and Ben Reilly, the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6286\" href=\"/scarlet-spider/4005-6286/\"> Scarlet Spider</a>.  Traveller was later betrayed by the majority of his<a data-ref-id=\"4060-55972\" href=\"/host/4060-55972/\">  Host </a>and the Scrier; Traveller hasn't been seen since. After Miles Warren returned as the Jackal, Osborn instructed a Scrier to confront him to stop the Jackal's mad scheme to unleash his <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14507\" href=\"/carrion/4005-14507/\"> Carrion</a> virus and replace the world's population with <a data-ref-id=\"4015-55828\" href=\"/clone/4015-55828/\"> clones</a>. While unsuccessful, it did buy time for Spider-Man and the Scarlet Spider to stop him.  <br /> <br />Following his return, Norman Osborn continued using the Scrier, including the procuring of an object of great interest from <a data-ref-id=\"4005-15631\" href=\"/alison-mongrain/4005-15631/\"> Alison Mongrain</a>, which also brought them into direct confrontation with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-8667\" href=\"/kaine/4005-8667/\"> Kaine</a>. They managed to apparently persevere, but this was never ellaborated on, even when Kaine made his eventual return some time later. <br /> </p> <h2>MC2-Universe</h2>The Scrier later became embroiled in an ongoing war with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3365\" href=\"/spider-girl/4005-3365/\"> Spider-Girl</a>, daughter of the true Spider-Man. They later broke Roderick Kingsley, the original <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7605\" href=\"/hobgoblin/4005-7605/\"> Hobgoblin</a>, out of prison to use against Spider-Girl in hopes of finishing her off. Although he Hobgoblin failed to kill Spider-Girl, he then severed all ties with the Scrier so he could concentrate on his own scheme, which centered around becoming the new <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1483\" href=\"/kingpin/4005-1483/\"> Kingpin of Crime</a>.",

Originally Zemo was a major threat during World War II and was the second most feared man throughout the Nazi regime, standing only one foot away from the <a href=\"/red-skull/4005-2250/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2250\">Red Skull</a> himself. Much like Red Skull, Zemo would also become a major threat for Captain America and <a href=\"/bucky-barnes/4005-40470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40470\">Bucky</a>. His hatred for the American hero would increase when his face was merged to the hooded mask that he was wearing during a fight against Captain America. Because of this incident, Zemo had long obsessed over the death of Captain America and was willing to cheat the Red Skull from doing it himself. After World War II was coming to an end and Red Skull was believed to have died, Zemo later lured both Captain America and Bucky into a trap that nearly killed both heroes. Believing that his nemesis and his annoying sidekick was finally dead, Zemo was unaware that both heroes managed to survive as Captain America accidentally went into suspended animation within arctic waters while Bucky was found by the communist Russians who brainwashed him into becoming their own assassin.</p><p>Zemo found himself avoiding capture for his war crimes after the war ended and relocated as a ruler in a South American tribe where he created his own private kingdom. After years of living in seclusion, Zemo would finally be shocked to learn of Captain America’s actual return and found himself dedicated to ensure that Captain America’s death would be more ensured once and for all.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1800922\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/56434/1800922-baronzemo1___copy__2_.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.93207547169811\" data-width=\"265\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 265px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/56434/1800922-baronzemo1___copy__2_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1800922\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/56434/1800922-baronzemo1___copy__2_.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/56434/1800922-baronzemo1___copy__2_.jpg 265w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 265px) 100vw, 265px\" data-width=\"265\"></a></figure><p>Zemo knew that Captain America’s newest allies, the Avengers would prove to be a threat against Captain America’s death, which forced him to take an alternate method to take on the his old enemy. Studying each member of the Avengers, Zemo carefully formed his own incarnation of villains that was comparable to the Avengers and with each member who individually posed a major threat towards a certain member of the Avengers. Recruiting villains like the <a href=\"/melter/4005-7260/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7260\">Melter</a> who once was a serious threat for <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man</a>, the criminal scientist known as <a href=\"/black-knight/4005-3172/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3172\">Black Knight</a> who tangled with both <a href=\"/hank-pym/4005-2247/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2247\">Ant Man</a> and <a href=\"/wasp/4005-1502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1502\">Wasp</a>, and <a href=\"/radioactive-man/4005-4807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4807\">Radioactive Man</a> who was a threat for the Mighty <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a> himself. With each villain promised his rightful vengeance by strength in numbers, secretly Zemo dubbed this team as the Masters of Evil. Even though each member served together for their promised opportunity for revenge, Zemo cared less for the motives of his team seeing how the main goal of the Masters of Evil was to ensure that there would be no obstacles that stood in his way when killing Captain America once and for all.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Masters of Evil were created by <a href=\"/stan-lee/4040-40467/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\">Jack Kirby</a> in 1964 and first appeared in <a href=\"/the-avengers/4050-2128/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2128\">The Avengers</a> #6.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-399234\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/399234-199795-masters-of-evil.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/399234-199795-masters-of-evil.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-399234\"><img alt=\"1st Masters of Evil\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/399234-199795-masters-of-evil.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/399234-199795-masters-of-evil.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"1st Masters of Evil\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/399234-199795-masters-of-evil.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/399234-199795-masters-of-evil.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\"></noscript></a><figcaption>1st Masters of Evil</figcaption></figure><p>Baron Zemo and his Masters of Evil decided that the best approach against the Avengers was to draw the heroes into battle. Zemo and his team did so when he attacked <a href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\">New York City</a> with his <a href=\"/adhesive-x/4055-56748/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56748\">Adhesive X</a>, a substance that was proclaimed to have no solution. With a majority of the population trapped by Zemo’s attack, the responding Avengers would find themselves unprepared against Zemo and the Masters of Evil because of the Adhesive X they were using. Capturing <a href=\"/hank-pym/4005-2247/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2247\">Giant Man</a> and Captain America, the remaining Avengers was forced into fleeing and finds a way to fight against the Masters of Evil and the Adhesive X. Much like Zemo, Captain America was shocked to learn of Zemo was still alive and the hero wanted revenge for death of his partner Bucky. Elsewhere the Avengers located the <a href=\"/trapster/4005-4328/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4328\">Trapster</a>, a villain who specializes in adhesive for a solution to Zemo’s Adhesive X.</p><p>With the help of Trapster because of wanting a lighter sentence for his prison term, the Avengers would secretly replace Zemo’s Adhesive X canisters with solvent and manage to trick the Masters of Evil into dissolving the Adhesive X. This led to all but one of the Masters of Evil to face defeat and incarceration while Zemo escaped with no army at his side for his personal quest to kill Captain America.</p><h3>Darkest Hour</h3><p>With Zemo left with no army, no hopes with accomplishing his task on killing Captain America, and that a desperate Captain America was on his trail for murdering his partner Bucky, Zemo would finally catch another opportunity with the Avengers when encountering <a href=\"/enchantress/4005-7225/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7225\">Enchantress</a> and the <a href=\"/executioner/4005-3517/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3517\">Executioner</a> who were both recently exiled from <a href=\"/asgard/4020-40990/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40990\">Asgard</a> for their crimes against Thor. As both Asgardians joined Zemo and recreated a shorter version of the Masters of Evil, Zemo had Enchantress mystically force Thor into fighting against his own teammates. Nearly managing on destroying the Avengers, the arrival of Iron Man would release Thor from his hypnotic trance, which followed the God of Thunder individually sending the Masters of Evil into another dimension.</p><h3>Wonder Man</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1851639\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1851639-wm1.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5422993492408\" data-width=\"461\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 461px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1851639-wm1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1851639\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5586/1851639-wm1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1851639-wm1.jpg 461w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5586/1851639-wm1.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5586/1851639-wm1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1851639-wm1.jpg 461w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5586/1851639-wm1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>After Enchantress managed to use her magic abilities to escape the dimension, Zemo decided that his next attack against the Avengers is by attacking them from within. By doing this, Zemo needed to recruit another member into the Masters of Evil and somebody who could easily pose as a hero. Deciding that the best way to do this is by also using his technology to grant ionic powers and to ensure absolute loyalty. Zemo would find a possible candidate for his goals within <a href=\"/hollywood/4005-25860/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25860\">Simon Williams</a>, who was recently fired for embezzlement. Blindly accepting Zemo’s offer for freedom from his prison stint and gaining powers, Zemo turned Willaims into an ionic-powered being dubbed <a href=\"/wonder-man/4005-1465/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1465\">Wonder Man</a>. Following through with Zemo’s plan by finding acceptance within the Avengers because of his heroic actions, Zemo would cue Wonder Man the precise moment to betray the Avengers and finally rid the heroes and Captain America once and for all.</p><p>To ensure full loyalty from Williams, Zemo also advise Willaims that his powers are temporary and that his body would need a periodically serum dosage to stabilize his ionic physiology. However Wonder Man would change his idea of luring the Avengers into Zemo’s trap and sacrificed himself to save his teammates from Zemo and the Masters of Evil.</p><h3>The Time Traveling Immortus</h3><p>Zemo and the Masters of Evil would later be approached by the time traveling Immortus who offered his assistance on defeating the Avengers. With Immortus sending Space Phantoms disguised as historical figures of the past to attack the Avengers, he also managed to send Captain America back to 1760 London. With Captain America gone, the Masters of Evil made their attack against the Avengers and nearly succeeded on defeating them until Immortus returned Captain America to his rightful place in time because of how he was impressed with his display of heroism.</p><p>With the Masters of Evil facing another defeat, Enchantress managed to restore time to before Zemo was approached by <a href=\"/immortus/4005-7215/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7215\">Immortus</a>. Even though time was restored within Reality-616, another reality known as Reality-64110 continues on with the fight and capture of the Masters of Evil.</p><h3>The Final Assault</h3><p>After his repeated and unsuccessful attempts, Zemo became desperate with Captain America’s demise and decided to rebuild his Masters of Evil to directly attack the Avengers and find a way to lure Captain America away from the team and take on the hero himself. Managing to have Melter and Black Knight escape from their prison term, Baron Zemo was unable to have Radioactive Man rejoin his group because of him being deported to <a href=\"/peoples-republic-of-china/4020-55795/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55795\">China</a> after his recent capture.</p><p>Still having an equal group compared to the Avengers, Zemo next kidnapped Rick Jones and took him to his secluded base in <a href=\"/south-america/4020-56960/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56960\">South America</a> as a way to lure Captain America to Zemo. As the Masters of Evil launched a full-scale attack on the Avengers, Captain America followed Zemo’s trail to his base and found himself battling Zemo and his hired men. As Zemo attempted to use his Death Ray against the Avenger, Captain America reflected the attack and caused Zemo to be blinded. Blinded and angered, Zemo shot his pistol wildly, which caused a landslide to crush and kill Baron Zemo. With Zemo dead, the remaining Masters of Evil didn’t fare any better, as all members were defeated and captured besides Enchantress and the Executioner who managed to escape.</p><p>With one of the teams greatest threats finally coming to an end, Captain America would personally bury Zemo’s body, as he would be convinced that Bucky’s death was finally avenged.</p><h3>The Mysterious Crimson Cowl</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-97587\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1808/97587-57665-masters-of-evil.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.996\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:99.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1808/97587-57665-masters-of-evil.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-97587\"><img alt=\"2nd Masters of Evil\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1808/97587-57665-masters-of-evil.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1808/97587-57665-masters-of-evil.jpg 250w\"><noscript><img alt=\"2nd Masters of Evil\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1808/97587-57665-masters-of-evil.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1808/97587-57665-masters-of-evil.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></noscript></a><figcaption>2nd Masters of Evil</figcaption></figure><p>Secretly acting indirectly and strictly behind the scenes, the psychotic robot known as <a href=\"/ultron/4005-2242/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2242\">Ultron</a> plan his attacks on the Avengers for the purposes of ruining his creator, Hank Pym. Adopting a criminal disguise as the <a href=\"/crimson-cowl/4005-22613/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22613\">Crimson Cowl</a>, Ultron would recruit Radioactive Man, Melter, <a href=\"/klaw/4005-3171/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3171\">Klaw</a>, <a href=\"/whirlwind/4005-6828/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6828\">Whirlwind</a>, and a new Black Knight who was the nephew of the original Black Knight who recently died from injuries after a battle with Iron Man. To make his true disguise and agenda more hidden, Ultron dubbed and recreated the team as the Masters of Evil. Managing to kidnap <a href=\"/jarvis/4005-1781/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1781\">Edwin Jarvis</a>, who was the butler for the Avengers, Ultron would hypnotize Jarvis into taking the disguise of the Crimson Cowl to further avoid his involvement or suspicion. Not only did Ultron frame Jarvis for his crimes as the Crimson Cowl, but also used him to gain information on the Avengers security systems and how to easily gain access into the <a href=\"/avengers-mansion/4020-41036/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41036\">mansion</a>. With this knowledge, Ultron guided his Masters of Evil into defeating and capturing the Avengers.</p><p>With the Avengers captured, Ultron next directed his attention against New York City. Eventually members within the Masters began to disagree with their leaders goals, which caused Klaw into attacking him after being berated. Simply shrugging off Klaw's attack, Ultrons identity was finally discovered before Black Knight freed the Avengers and managed to defeat the criminal group after Ultron made his escape. With the Masters defeated, Black Knight would reveal himself to the Avengers as a hero who was following his uncles dying wish of not following the same footsteps as he did and decided to restore heroism to the Black Knight name by single handily defeating the reincarnated Masters of Evil.</p><p>Even though Ultron decided to move on without the assistance of any humans, this version of the Masters of Evil still continued to work together as they made another attempt against the Avengers. Yet, this version would prove less successful as they faced another quick defeat, which caused the Masters of Evil to part ways.</p><h3>Egghead's Ultimate Revenge</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1081437\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1081437-1_3_2010_12_23_03_pm.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.70894677236693\" data-width=\"1766\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1766px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1081437-1_3_2010_12_23_03_pm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1081437\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/1/11352/1081437-1_3_2010_12_23_03_pm.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1081437-1_3_2010_12_23_03_pm.jpg 1766w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/1/11352/1081437-1_3_2010_12_23_03_pm.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/1081437-1_3_2010_12_23_03_pm.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/1/11352/1081437-1_3_2010_12_23_03_pm.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1081437-1_3_2010_12_23_03_pm.jpg 1766w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/1/11352/1081437-1_3_2010_12_23_03_pm.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/1081437-1_3_2010_12_23_03_pm.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></noscript></a></figure><p>A third Masters of Evil would be created when the criminal scientist known as <a href=\"/egghead/4005-3797/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3797\">Egghead</a> sought assistance with his plot for gaining revenge against Hank Pym and manipulating him into serving him. What was supposed to be the ultimate plan against Pym who recently was shunned from the Avengers, Egghead broke Whirlwind, <a href=\"/mac-gargan/4005-4484/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4484\">Scorpion</a>, <a href=\"/tiger-shark/4005-6815/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6815\">Tiger Shark</a>, and <a href=\"/moonstone/4005-3279/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3279\">Moonstone</a> out of form his own criminal group. However Egghead's plan would find itself quickly threatened when Whirlwind anticipated his attack on the Avengers by trying to gain revenge against the Wasp for his prior defeats. Forcing the remaining Masters to attack the unsuspecting Avengers, the criminal group found itself easily bested by the Avengers and sent back to prison. However Egghead was far from giving up on needing a group and decided to free Tiger Shark and Moonstone, but replaced Whirlwind and Scorpion with the <a href=\"/abe-jenkins/4005-4822/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4822\">Beetle</a>, <a href=\"/shocker/4005-4825/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4825\">Shocker</a>, and Radioactive Man.</p><p>After remaking the roster, Egghead sent the group to kidnap Pym from court and make it look like Pym was working with the Masters so that he could increase the damage on Pym’s reputation as a hero.

Baron Heinrich Zemo not only took up his father’s mantle as a criminal mastermind, but also followed his father’s very same footsteps by attempting to destroy Captain America and the Avengers. This time Zemo decided to take more calculating steps on bringing the Avengers to their knee’s by forming not only a new incarnation of the Masters of Evil, but also a massive army that consisted of the most dangerous and deadliest foes who individually posed a threat for the Avengers. Zemo’s army mostly consisted of villains that had brute strength and such as <a href=\"/goliath/4005-3470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3470\">Goliath</a>, <a href=\"/mr-hyde/4005-3233/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3233\">Mr. Hyde</a>, the <a href=\"/wrecking-crew/4060-18519/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-18519\">Wrecking Crew</a>, <a href=\"/absorbing-man/4005-1779/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1779\">Absorbing Man</a>, and <a href=\"/titania/4005-4943/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4943\">Titania</a>. Some members were specifically important for Zemo such as <a href=\"/blackout/4005-41820/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41820\">Blackout</a> who displayed powers of manipulating the dark force and Moonstone who was the only one that could control him and his actions. Even though Moonstone did pose a threat against Zemo’s leadership, he still kept her at a close distance and hid the fact that he had <a href=\"/fixer/4005-3282/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3282\">Fixer</a> implant commands in Blackout’s mind that could make him control Blackout if ever needed too.</p><p>Aside from Moonstone and Blackout, Fixer also assisted Zemo for his abnormal mechanical skills that also proved very useful for Zemo. Prior to his attack on the Avengers, Zemo sent a few villains such Yellow Jacket, Absorbing Man, and Titania to find possible recruits to help him and the Masters of Evil storm the Avengers Mansion. Yet these attempts proved unsuccessful and ended with <a href=\"/grey-gargoyle/4005-6816/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6816\">Grey Gargoyle</a> and <a href=\"/songbird/4005-3281/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3281\">Screaming Mimi</a> being arrested, also a meddling <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man</a> managed to defeat both Absorbing Man and Titania while trying to recruit <a href=\"/mongoose/4005-25662/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25662\">Mongoose</a>. During this time, Zemo amused himself by sending both Whirlwind and Trapster to attack Captain America for initiation within his group. Knowing that both villains would fail, Zemo specifically sent Whirlwind on this mission because of his prior incident with the former Masters group that caused their defeat and could be a threat for his plans.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2422512\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2422512-ohotmu_avengers__1___page_33.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.3163064833006\" data-width=\"509\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 509px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:131.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2422512-ohotmu_avengers__1___page_33.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2422512\"><img alt=\"Avengers (1963) #277\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px\" data-width=\"486\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2422512-ohotmu_avengers__1___page_33.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2422512-ohotmu_avengers__1___page_33.jpg 509w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2422512-ohotmu_avengers__1___page_33.jpg 486w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Avengers (1963) #277\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2422512-ohotmu_avengers__1___page_33.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2422512-ohotmu_avengers__1___page_33.jpg 509w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2422512-ohotmu_avengers__1___page_33.jpg 486w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px\" data-width=\"486\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Avengers (1963) #277</figcaption></figure><p>With Thor, who was one of the Avengers most powerful members being absent, Zemo waited for the exact opportunity to strike and did so when seeing most of the Avengers away from the building. Zemo and his army of super-villains not only managed to successfully infiltrate the mansion, but also captured Captain America, Black Knight, and Jarvis, also using Blackout to send <a href=\"/captain-marvel/4005-1472/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1472\">Captain Marvel</a> into the <a href=\"/darkforce/4015-41411/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-41411\">Darkforce</a>, and nearly beating <a href=\"/hercules/4005-2503/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2503\">Hercules</a> to death. With the mansion completely taken over by Zemo and the Masters, Zemo used Blackout to shield the entire mansion with his Darkforce powers so that nobody would be able to enter or leave the mansion. With Hercules hospitalized, Zemo sent both Titania and Absorbing Man to ensure that his death was fulfilled, but this attempt found itself failing as both Ant-Man (<a href=\"/scott-lang/4005-20577/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20577\">Scott Lang</a>) and Wasp managed to prevent both Masters from killing Hercules. With Captain America captured and taunted by Zemo, the Avenger found himself forced into watching Jarvis being tortured and beaten by Mr. Hyde. With the destruction of the Avengers almost complete, the arrival of Thor and the remaining Avengers proved successful on defeating most of the Masters as they managed to penetrate into the mansion.</p><p>As Thor and arriving Avengers, Zemo were defeating most of the Masters retreated to the roof with Blackout as the released Captain America pursued against him. Zemo would also find himself unable to use Blackout with the implanted commands because of <a href=\"/doctor-druid/4005-10302/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10302\">Dr. Druid</a> who was mentally guiding Blackout to retaliate against Zemo; this resulted with Blackout dying from a brain hemorrhage. With the Masters facing defeat and the Avengers building being nearly destroyed, Zemo made his attempt on fighting against Captain America only to find himself falling to his seemingly death. Believing to be dead, Zemo managed to survive the fall and hid underground to rethink his plans against Captain America while the Avengers found themselves reorganizing and rebuilding the damages from Zemo’s attack.</p><h3>The Raid of Dr Octopus</h3><p>With a new cosmic threat arising known as <a href=\"/magus/4005-14619/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14619\">Magus</a>, this forced most of the well-known heroic teams to fight against on their attempts to save reality. After noticing the heroes taking absence, <a href=\"/doctor-octopus/4005-1485/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1485\">Dr Octopus</a> decided that the time was right to raid the Avengers Mansion and steal any scientific equipment that would prove useful for research. Possibly influenced by Zemo’s prior attack on the Avengers, Dr Octopus made his attempt to follow the same footsteps by forming his own Masters of Evil to help him raid the mansion and handle any possible threats that they may encounter.</p><p>Even though Dr Octopus made his attempt to follow Zemo’s same footsteps, his greatest flaw was his selection for the Masters, which half of the villains found themselves instantly defeated by the Avengers staff and the arriving <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-galaxy/4060-25956/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-25956\">Guardians of the Galaxy</a>. Despite Dr Octopus and a few Masters being capable of handling themselves against the Guardians, their encounter was interrupted by evil doppelgangers sent by Magus. Forced into forming an alliance with the Guardians, both teams managed to fend off the doppelgangers. Yet Dr. Octopus was still reluctant to raid the mansion and found that his remaining team opposed him. With the Masters of Evil defeated and departed, Dr. Octopus was forced to flee as well one of the opposing Masters known as <a href=\"/rita-demara/4005-1501/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1501\">Yellowjacket</a> found herself joining the Guardians of the Galaxy.</p><h3>Justice, Like Lightning</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2168580\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68065/2168580-499872889.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5185454545455\" data-width=\"1375\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1375px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68065/2168580-499872889.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2168580\"><img alt=\"Thunderbolts by Declan Shalvey\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/68065/2168580-499872889.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68065/2168580-499872889.jpg 1375w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/68065/2168580-499872889.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/68065/2168580-499872889.jpg 632w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Thunderbolts by Declan Shalvey\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/68065/2168580-499872889.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68065/2168580-499872889.jpg 1375w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/68065/2168580-499872889.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/68065/2168580-499872889.jpg 632w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Thunderbolts by Declan Shalvey</figcaption></figure><p>Returning to his role as leader of the Masters of Evil, Zemo individually recruited each member of his newest formation of the Masters of Evil.

Seeing the absence of Earth's mightiest heroes as an opportunity to have the world under his control, Zemo and his Masters took a unique step on accomplishing this by secretly posing as heroes to gain public trust, trust that would put Zemo and his Masters closer to their goals. With Fixer’s aid, the Masters found themselves re-equipped and taking different names as the entire group made their public appearance as the heroic Thunderbolts. In an ironic twist, Zemo and the <a href=\"/thunderbolts/4060-23977/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-23977\">Thunderbolts</a> found themselves fighting another group who called themselves the Masters of Evil who was led by another mysterious Crimson Cowl. Even though Zemo’s plan was proving successful as the Thunderbolts were gaining public trust as heroes, a rising threat towards his goals of world domination began to rise within the group when some of the members began following their heroic counterparts.</p><p>Taking notice as to how some members began to steer away from Zemo’s goals, Zemo pre-planned this by revealing their secret identities to public prior to his attempt for world takeover, forcing them into staying loyal to his plans and goals. As Zemo and the reluctant Thunderbolts managed to take over the world through means of mind control, the group found itself split apart as most of the Thunderbolts found themselves following their heroic identities by going against Zemo and <a href=\"/fixer/4005-3282/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3282\">Techno</a>.

Things to a tragic turn when she was outsmarted by Moonstone of the Hawkeye's Thunderbolts who tricked her into thinking she would side with her, while the rest of her teammates defeated the large roster of super villains.</p><p>However, the Crimson Cowl got the better of them when she teleported herself away and replaced herself with <a href=\"/dallas-riordan/4005-4826/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4826\">Dallas Riordan</a> as a way to fooling the Thunderbolts and the super-human community in thinking Riohard and turned traitor, but she was soon freed by the <a href=\"/v-battalion/4060-22646/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-22646\">V-battalion</a> who broke out her out of prison.

However, Hawkeye ends up defeating the various members and escaping with Cap in tow. Leading the Shadow Council to finish their Masters of Evil and launch them against the Avengers.</p><p>Max Fury lead over 50 members of his new Masters of Evil to be the heralds of the Abyss, which was revealed to need the Serpent Crown, the Crown of Thorns and the Crown of Wolves to unlock the gateway back to the 616 Universe. However, after joining the crowns together, he was unable to use the powers of the Abyss since he was an artificial being. The Taskmaster, who was fatally wounded dawn the crown and became the herald for the Abyss and used the Masters of Evil and the Secret Avengers to spread the powers of the Abyss to the rest of the planet.</p><p>Venom and Ant-man who were unaffected by the Abyss due to the symbiot's powers and Ant-man being an LMD were able to stop the Abyss by using the symbiote on the Taskmaster and redividing the crowns. In doing so, the Abyss lost it's grip on the possessed Avengers and Masters and the crown was taken by the Secret Avengers and hidden in various pocket universes where they could guard them more closely. The Shadow Council as a result fell apart as both Thorndrake and Steel were killed and Max Fury fled back to the Decedents.</p><h3>Masters of Evil Reunion</h3><p>A very familiar lineup of Masters of Evil would return under the command of <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/lightmaster/4005-13938/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13938\">the Lightmaster</a> in an attempt to steal a Quantum Energy Transporter.

Fighting as a team the Masters came close to gaining the upper hand several times in the fight with Titania and the Absorbing Man destroying a Spider Walker and Blackout managing to interfere with the Superior Spiderman's control of his 'allies'.</p><p>In the end the Masters were temporarily defeated when Sungirl activated the device Lightmaster had stolen causing herself, the Six, Lightmaster and Spiderman to teleport to another location. It can be assumed that after Lightmaster's arrest the rest of the Master's disbanded or were apprehended by local law enforcement.</p><h3>Zemo's Return</h3><p>Baron Zemo would once again take control of the Masters of Evil and attempt to recreate a team worthy of using the title. He hired <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/madame-masque/4005-13940/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13940\">Madame Masque</a>, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/hellstorm/4005-14695/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14695\">Hellstrom</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/constrictor/4005-2127/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2127\">Constrictor</a> and was approached by the young hero <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/bloodstone/4005-86740/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86740\">Bloodstone</a> in his search for <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/arcade/4005-8429/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8429\">Arcade</a>.

The <a href=\"/supreme-intelligence/4005-6096/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6096\">Supreme Intelligence</a> forced the Kree into a new form of evolution the Ruul. The Ruul were the main instigators of maximum security.</p><p>The Kree started out as a primitive species sharing their planet <a href=\"/hala/4020-56002/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56002\">Hala</a> with the <a href=\"/cotati/4060-46135/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-46135\">Cotati</a>, a race of plantlike humanoids. Their planet was visited by the <a href=\"/skrulls/4060-40668/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40668\">Skrulls</a>, whom at the time where a peaceful race. They told the Kree and the Cotati that one of their species would be chosen to represent their planet in an interplanetary counsel. To chose which species it would be; they sent both the Kree and the Cotati to our moon, and told them each to build a city there. The species that built the best one would be chosen to represent the planet. The Kree labored over building a city (what is now the blue area of the moon) while the Cotati slept. When the Skrulls came back to the moon to award a winner they found that the Cotati had grown a huge garden while they slept! The Cotati won the contest. Furious, the Kree killed all of the Cotati and all of the Skrulls that visited their planet. They then used the Skrull ship to go to the Skrull home world and start the Kree-Skrull wars.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1608302-1_8_2011_10_28_57_pm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1608302\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5164454702827\" data-width=\"1733\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1733px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1608302-1_8_2011_10_28_57_pm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1608302\"><img alt=\"As told by the Kree\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1608302-1_8_2011_10_28_57_pm.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1608302-1_8_2011_10_28_57_pm.jpg 1733w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/1/11352/1608302-1_8_2011_10_28_57_pm.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/1608302-1_8_2011_10_28_57_pm.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1608302-1_8_2011_10_28_57_pm.jpg 422w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px\" data-width=\"422\"></a><figcaption>As told by the Kree</figcaption></figure><p>The Second Kree-Skull War was started by the Skrulls although the Kree were considering it. The Skrulls were led by <a href=\"/kylor/4005-56638/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56638\">Kylor</a>, one of five claiming to be Emperor of the Skrulls. After capturing a Kree spy on one of their worlds they decided to strike first. When the Supreme Intelligence lost his mind, <a href=\"/nenora/4005-56642/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56642\">Nenora</a> took over as Supreme Leader. Nenora was secretly a Skrull, but choose to remain a Kree and rule over all. She betrayed Kylor and her people. The Skrull campaign was taken over by Empress <a href=\"/sbyll/4005-41667/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41667\">S'byll</a> after Kylor's death. Nenora was defeated by S'byll when she gave Nenora her shape-shifting powers back. S'byll announced to the Kree their leader was truly a Skrull and that she had won the war. But, S'byll declared a peace. Tus-Katt was the highest ranking member available and he did not accept a peace, this was against all the Kree stand for. The best he could accept was a truce, which she accepted.</p><p>With the loss of the Supreme Intelligence and Nenora the Kree were left without a leader. Through manipulation, the <a href=\"/contemplator/4005-13988/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13988\">Contemplator</a> was able to get the pirate <a href=\"/clumsy-foulup/4005-29131/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29131\">Clumsy Foulup</a> to become emperor. The emperor was assassinated by <a href=\"/ael-dan/4005-27760/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27760\">Ael-Dan</a> and <a href=\"/dar-ben/4005-27761/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27761\">Dar-Benn</a>. They ruled the empire together, one being of blue skin and one of pink.

The whole Kree/Shi'ar War was orchestrated by the Supreme Intelligence as a way to jump start the Kree's evolutionary dead end, thus the Ruul was born.

Under their poor leadership, the Kree are easy targets for the Annihilation Wave.</p><p>The Fiyero Kree attempt to make a deal and join forces with Annihilus so that the war would end and they could go back to their commerce. Finding the proof of his betrayal, Ronan executes the enemies of the empire and is named leader of the Kree after the mercy killing of the Supreme Intelligence (who had already been lobotomized by the Fiyero).

He is attacked by two Skrulls just before the invasion, his fate is currently unknown.</p><p>Due to the Skrulls having abducted <a href=\"/black-bolt/4005-4329/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4329\">Black Bolt</a>, the <a href=\"/inhumans/4060-11427/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-11427\">Inhumans</a> form an alliance with the Kree in an effort to locate him. Ronan's price for this alliance is the hand of <a href=\"/crystal/4005-2115/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2115\">Crystal</a> of the Inhuman Royal Family, a price her sister readily accepts. In the aftermath of the invasion the Inhumans leave the moon and travel to Kree space. They breach the barrier and confront Ronan who relinquishes the throne to <a href=\"/black-bolt/4005-4329/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4329\">Black Bolt</a>.</p><h3>War of Kings</h3><p>During the Inhumans vengeance upon the Skrulls, a group of Shi'ar Warbirds are destroyed. <a href=\"/vulcan/4005-21233/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21233\">Emperor Vulcan</a> takes this as a challenge and sets his sights on conquering the Kree. The second Kree/Shi'ar War begins with the Shi'ar crashing the wedding of Ronan the Accuser and <a href=\"/crystal/4005-2115/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2115\">Crystal</a>.</p><p>Black Bolt unleashes his weapon known as the T-Bomb, a device made with the Terrigen Mists, in the belief it will make everyone into Inhumans and end the war. With the detonation of the bomb, Black Bolt and Vulcan both perish, and it also creates a rip in space known as the <a href=\"/the-fault/4020-56597/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56597\">Fault</a>. With Black Bolt presumed dead, leadership of the Kree Empire is left to <a href=\"/medusa/4005-4327/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4327\">Medusa</a>.</p><h3>War of the Four Cities</h3><p>It would come to be known that the experiment that created the Inhumans was prophesied to be the end of the Supreme Intelligence. Of the 100 races created, the Supreme Intelligence ordered them all destroyed. But five races survived. They would all come together to try and make the Earth their new home. The Inhumans, now lead by Black Bolt who had returned from the dead, left the empire in the hands of Ronan.</p><p>After all houses agreed to have him as leader, he and Crystal left for Earth to take complete control of the Kree Empire once and for all.</p><h2>Genetics</h2><p><u>Reproduction</u></p><p>The Kree people procreate naturally between male and females of the species. Valuing what they consider to be their genetic purity, reproduction outside of the species is strictly prohibited taboo.</p><p>It is considered a punishable crime In the Kree empire for a male non-Kree to impregnate any Kree female. Even though it is possible to produce hybrid offspring between a great many races separate from their native race. Like <a href=\"/carol-danvers/4005-21561/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21561\">Carol Danvers</a> of the planet Earth.</p><p><u>Evolution</u></p><p>The Kree, initially rendered progressively stunted due to the <a href=\"/phoenix-force/4005-2164/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2164\">Phoenix Force</a> punishing their ancestry for attempting to harness the <a href=\"/mkraan-crystal/4055-44426/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-44426\">M'Kraan Crystal</a> for their own ends much like the Skrulls. Still possessed the latent potential to produce super humanoid beings through preternatural or outside mutation, genetic engineering, or cutting edge cybernetics technology along the evolutionary chain.</p><p>This theory was tested to the most extreme degree by a plan, known only to a few among their number, by the Supreme Intelligence via activating and discharging a Kree <a href=\"/nega-bomb/4055-59347/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-59347\">Nega Bomb</a> in the middle of Kree space. A secret plan disguised as a war induced incursion into their universal sector during <a href=\"/operation-galactic-storm/4045-27758/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-27758\">Operation: Galactic Storm</a>, a heated war involving the Shi'ar wherein Earth was caught in the middle as the former attempted to open a stargate channel between the Milky Way galaxy to territories owned by Hala.</p><p>The radioactive fallout of it's explosion. While having all but decimated the <a title=\"Kree Empire\" href=\"https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kree_Empire\">Kree Empire</a>, had heavily altered the genetic structures of many survivors' whom weathered through the holocaust.</p><p>Causing a quick yet steady mutation in their genetics brought about by adaptation to the negative radiation. Thus enabling the them to escape their evolutionary deadlock, allegedly granting them unlimited potential. Other signs of potential evolution stem from the existence of artificial Homo Superior among the Kree race named Tsu-Zana. Whom was created with her own mutant X-Gene in order to overthrow the domination of both <a title=\"Shi'ar (Race)\" href=\"https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Shi%27ar_(Race)\">Shi'ar</a> and blue-skinned Kree, as their savior.</p><p>As with many species across the Marvel Universe, two adjacent cosmic enclaves had performed genetic experiments on the primitive ancestors of the Kree millennia ago. The being the most prolific of whom being the <a href=\"/celestials/4060-13343/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13343\">Celestials</a>, cosmological titans that; as with primordial humanity, had divided the prehistoric Kree between Deviant and Eternal communities. While another less colloquial race of space god called the <a href=\"/progenitors/4060-63313/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-63313\">Progenitors</a>, first introduced the tertiary chain of special existence which the Kree would study profusely for years to come. The first in a long series of genetic regression known as Inhumanity.</p><p>While the record of Kree Eternal/Deviant interaction remains largely undisclosed to current date. The Eternal's were once a thriving community on Hala which eventually dwindled to it's lone purveyor <a href=\"/demon-druid/4005-14892/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14892\">Ultimus</a>, whom would soon find his way to Earth.</p><p>Ard-Con being the last known living Kree Eternal specimen to date.

A few among the Kree bred with other alien species, producing the \"Pink-Skinned\" Kree, a second class citizenry who appear similar to Caucasian earth born humans. Though they outnumber their \"Blue-Skinned\" cousins a hundred to one, they are a suppressed minority whom're often used as slave labor in the empire.</p><p>There is a rare subset of altered Kree whom, via exposure to egentic tempering or unique blends of radiology. Are known to develop superhuman abilities beyond the regular norm of their race. Such individuals include Captain <a href=\"/captain-marvel/4005-1472/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1472\">Mar-Vell</a>, <a href=\"/captain-atlas/4005-27096/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27096\">Att-Lass</a>, <a href=\"/dr-minerva/4005-26673/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26673\">Minn-Erva</a> and <a href=\"/commando/4005-9712/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9712\">M'Nell</a>.</p><p>In the event of cohabitation with other species across the universe, certain hybrid species are born from said union.

An imperium ruled by a cosmic uni-mind known as the Supreme Intelligence, it/they are the absolute authority of their entire galaxy spanning civilization.</p><p>A conquistador race where Soldiers and commanders are subservient to the Supremor's Accusers as are the Accusers to the Supreme Intelligence. A civilization built on the concept of expansionism, they're main objective as a superpower is not to make contact but to subjugate and enslave.</p><p>As such, Kree science is considered second to none even by an intergalactic standard. Being many leagues higher than that of Earth. Much of which being devoted to their own evolutionary advancement.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Super-Humanoid Strength: The Kree have adapted to a heavier gravity than the people of Earth, therefore they gain a greater increase in physicals compared to the average adult homo sapiens. Able to lift between 1 and 1.2 metric tons of weight.</p><p>Super-Humanoid Speed: Mar-Vell was considered fast even by Kree standard, possessing a level of speed that would qualify as enhanced for a human.</p><p>Super-Humanoid Stamina: Kree bodily fibers are comparatively more enhanced than those of the finest mammalian specimen.

Having more resilient to impact, pressure, and temperature extremes.</p><p>Super-Humanoid Reflexes: A seasoned Kree soldiers reactions are considered beyond those belonging to the finest human athlete, making it possible for them to dodge gunfire, even at point-blank range, from multiple gunmen at once.</p><p>Super-Humanoid Agility: The Kree are physically more limber than many species. Able to leap and bound at incredible heights in an instant.</p><p>Seventh Sense: The females of the Kree often undergo biophysical stunting surgery for the purpose of locating and removing psychic potential inherent among only they're gender. Uncastrated women among the Kree possess mental abilities ranging along clairvoyance, precognition and/or pheromonal and biophysical siphoning attributes. Powers that range from domination of the opposite sex to even lethal effect, like reaching into the mind of the opposite sex to moderate their desires or drain they're life force completely.</p><h2>Kree Groups</h2><h3>Attilan</h3><p>A group of Kree comes to <a href=\"/attilan/4020-44155/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-44155\">Attilan</a> to beg for sanctuary. They are attacked at first until they tell what they're there. They are then given tents to stay in, in the empty place of old Kree machinery. A group of Kree goes to kill the Inhuman Royal Family but is stopped. Another is gone to the Genetics Council to see if the hearing goes in their favor for them to stay permanently. Another group is mad that they have to beg the Inhumans, creatures they created for their slaves. They decide to go and destroy the one thing that gives them their powers, the <a href=\"/terrigen-crystals/4055-55807/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55807\">Terrigen Crystals.</a> When they get there, they are attacked by Inhumans. They tell the Inhumans they don't want to destroy the mists but use them. They tell them when the Avengers hit the <a href=\"/nega-bands/4055-42360/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-42360\">Nega Bands</a> above their city it did something to their genes so they could use the mists. Three went in and two came out alive.</p><p>The Kree attacked the Inhumans. They caught them very easily but with causalities. They separated the Inhumans by age, separating the old from the young. They sends machines over the city, for when <a href=\"/black-bolt/4005-4329/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4329\">Black Bolt</a> screamed they picked the city up. The Kree wanted <a href=\"/ronan/4005-4818/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4818\">Ronan</a> to help build up their status in the universe, they wanted to rule the <a href=\"/shiar/4060-55854/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55854\">Shi'ar</a>. Ronan was to send the Inhumans to attack the Shi'ar.</p><h3>Priests of Pama</h3><p>The <a href=\"/priests-of-pama/4060-57481/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57481\">Priests of Pama</a> are a group of pacifist Kree.

Hoping to gain peace, <a href=\"/marius/4005-7902/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7902\">Marius</a> agreed to marry <a href=\"/bella-donna/4005-7896/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7896\">Bella Donna</a>, his daughter, to <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/gambit/4005-1499/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1499\">Remy</a>.

Domino set free some women that were being trafficked and stole 237 million dollars that the Guild was after. They sent <a href=\"/razorfist/4005-15449/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15449\">Razorfist</a> to get her, however he failed and they called <a href=\"/boomerang/4005-6299/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6299\">Boomerang</a>, <a href=\"/nakh/4005-17371/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-17371\">Nakh</a>, <a href=\"/clay/4005-6121/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6121\">Clay</a>, <a href=\"/black-mamba/4005-30719/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30719\">Black Mamba</a>, <a href=\"/bullet/4005-3125/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3125\">Bullet</a> and <a href=\"/bushwacker/4005-11932/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11932\">Bushwacker</a> to go after her, as well as <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a> who sided with her.</p><p>Most recently the Guild has turned its sights on <a href=\"/kaine/4005-8667/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8667\">Kaine</a> as during his years as the malfunctioning clone of <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Peter Parker</a> he moved in on the Assassin Guilds' turf and took on contract killings without paying tithe to the Guild. Kaine at the time blatantly refused to pay and disappeared for a years until he reappeared in <a href=\"/houston/4020-57893/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57893\">Houston</a>, now under the guise of the Scarlet Spider. After beating the killers <a href=\"/bella-donna/4005-7896/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7896\">Bella Donna</a> sent after him, Kaine offered her a deal saying he would either do one job for her or he would kill each and every member of the Assassins Guild one by one. A deal Bella Donna accepted.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h4>X-Men: The Animated Series</h4><p>Here they appeared in the episode <strong>X-Ternally Yours</strong>. Much of their history remains the same, although not many of the guild members are seen or mentioned.</p><h4>X-Men Evolution</h4><p>Here they are mentioned in the episode <strong>Cajun Spice</strong>, although not much is known about them other than them being a rival guild to the Thieves Guild.

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The <a href=\"/vanisher/4005-6756/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6756\">Vanisher</a> was never a moral individual. As a mutant with the ability to teleport anywhere he wished, he often used his skills to steal or blackmail others. Yet after an adventure when he was caught travelling through another dimension with the teleporting <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Man</a> known as <a href=\"/nightcrawler/4005-1461/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1461\">Nightcrawler</a>, the Vanisher decided it was time to take life a little easier. So he settled down in <a href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\">New York</a> and gathered around him a group of teenaged runaways.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In exchange for giving them shelter in his Beat Street Club, they would have to go out on the city streets and steal whatever they could find. Picking pockets, stealing purses and swiping food, they would take back their ill-gotten gains to the Vanisher who would then keep a large percentage of it for himself. Sometimes the Vanisher managed to recruit girls with super human powers, which would aid them in their daily quest to find more money and food. Yet the girls didn't always appreciate his unique brand of generosity, and sometimes girls like <a href=\"/boom-boom/4005-2159/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2159\">Boom-Boom</a> would leave after they demanded more.</p><h3>Aliens &amp; Cyborgs</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The all-girl group underwent a few changes after Boom-Boom was taken in by <a href=\"/x-factor/4060-24131/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-24131\">X-Factor</a> Most of the regular human girls left the team, leaving <a href=\"/ariel/4005-41840/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41840\">Ariel</a> and <a href=\"/chance-fallen-angels/4005-44914/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44914\">Chance</a> to find new members. Chance was believed to be a normal human, while Ariel gladly used her space-bending teleportation as often as possible. Together they tracked down a young boy nicknamed <a href=\"/gomi/4005-7913/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7913\">Gomi</a> (Japanese for 'garbage') and his two lobster associates <a href=\"/bill/4005-7631/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7631\">Bill</a> &amp; <a href=\"/don/4005-7912/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7912\">Don</a></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">All three of them were cyborgs resulting from the experiments of Gomi's older cousin, while Don was also considered to be a mutant lobster due to his blue coloration. Unbeknownst to the Vanisher, Ariel had a hidden agenda; she didn't just want to repopulate his team of young thieves, she was recruiting as many mutated beings as she could find. As a team, this group of runaways would be known as the Fallen Angels.</p><h3>Mutants</h3><figure style=\"width: 400px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/181224-29118-new-mutants.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-181224\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.9825\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:98.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/181224-29118-new-mutants.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-181224\"><img alt=\"Sunspot Knocks Cannonball Unconscious\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/181224-29118-new-mutants.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/181224-29118-new-mutants.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>Sunspot Knocks Cannonball Unconscious</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Gomi always was a hard worker, who didn't seem to mind doing the chores that no-one else wanted to do. Yet it was Chance who accidentally stumbled across their first new mutant. <a href=\"/sunspot/4005-4644/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4644\">Sunspot</a> had recently runaway from the <a href=\"/new-mutants/4060-15971/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15971\">New Mutants</a> after he lashed out at his best friend and accidentally knocked <a href=\"/cannonball/4005-1496/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1496\">Cannonball</a> unconscious.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">He'd run away to the city where he found Chance being threatened by local street thugs. Although Ariel rescued Chance leaving Sunspot to face the thugs alone, they later went in search of their first mutant.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">By the time Gomi, Bill &amp; Don found Sunspot, he was accompanied by Warlock. Fortunately for Ariel &amp; Chance, <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto</a> and <a href=\"/moira-mactaggert/4005-8304/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8304\">Moira MacTaggert</a> had sent <a href=\"/siryn/4005-3181/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3181\">Siryn</a> &amp; <a href=\"/madrox/4005-7910/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7910\">Multiple Man</a> in search of the two runaway New Mutants and therefore they also joined the team. At the time they believed that Boom-Boom was being held prisoner by the mutant hunters, <a href=\"/x-factor/4060-24131/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-24131\">X-Factor</a>, so Ariel demonstrated her space-bending alien abilities to everyone just in time to save Boom-Boom as she was being chased by <a href=\"/beast/4005-1462/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1462\">Beast</a> &amp; <a href=\"/iceman/4005-1464/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1464\">Iceman</a>. Ariel's collection of young mutants was completed after a brief inter-galactic trip to a jungle-forest planet where they recruited <a href=\"/devil-dinosaur/4005-2172/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2172\">Devil Dinosaur</a> and <a href=\"/moon-boy/4005-7224/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7224\">Moon Boy</a>.</p><h3>Multiple Trouble</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Returning back to New York the Vanisher sent the team out to scavenge more food. They paired off with Ariel &amp; Chance, Sunspot &amp; Warlock, Siryn &amp; Multiple Man, and Boom-Boom with Gomi and the lobsters. While Ariel &amp; Chance were tormenting Sunspot &amp; Warlock, Boom-Boom discovered one of Multiple Man's duplicates wandering around the street. He desperately ran away from her and didn't watch where he was going when he ran into the street. A cyclist hit the duplicate breaking some of his ribs, the pain of which was fed to the original Multiple Man a few streets away.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In the midst of all the chaos, no-one had noticed that Devil Dinosaur &amp; Moon Boy had slipped out of the Beast Street Club. Despite the dinosaur's large physique and bizarre appearance on a New York street, they were unnoticed until a large cracking noise as heard. It was the tragic demise of Don, who had been crushed underfoot by Devil Dinosaur.</p><figure style=\"width: 600px\" data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29818/691891-meltdown06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-691891\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.40166666666667\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:40.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29818/691891-meltdown06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-691891\"><img alt=\"Ariel &amp; Chance Nearly Spill The Beans To Boom-Boom\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/29818/691891-meltdown06.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29818/691891-meltdown06.jpg 600w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/29818/691891-meltdown06.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Ariel &amp; Chance Nearly Spill The Beans To Boom-Boom</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">As the remaining Fallen Angels feasted at Don's wake, Multiple Man and his rogue duplicate discussed re-absorption, how that would be like dying, and the possibilities of further mutation. The duplicate didn't want to be re-absorbed and opted to have his own life, even if it meant living with the pain of broken ribs. They theorised that it was a further mutation or Multiple Man's own multiplying power. Using the portable <a href=\"/cerebro/4055-15073/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-15073\">Cerebro</a> unit that Magneto had given them to find Sunspot &amp; Warlock, the Multiple Men began to detect the presence of two new mutants: Ariel &amp; Chance.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Meanwhile, the young mutants began to experience strange fluctuations in their mutant powers. A slight tap would trigger off dozens of Multiple Men duplicates, while Siryn could suddenly shatter metal, and the Vanisher vanished uncontrollably. Then as a complete reversal, all of their powers would suddenly disappear. Multiple Man's duplicates all mysteriously disappeared (except for the wounded one), Boom-Boom's time-bomb didn't detonate, and Warlock became murderously enraged. The wounded Multiple Man duplicate continued to study Cerebro, but he could not yet determine whether it was Chance or Ariel that was causing the trouble.</p><h3>Betrayal</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ariel convinced the others that New York was too much trouble, and that she the best place for them: The Coconut Grove. There the team were treated like VIPs and received a make-over from their hosts. All except Chance who screamed in terror at the prospect of being feminine, and was subsequently mocked by Sunspot. The team was relaxed and didn't suspect a thing. The girls tormented Sunspot, Multiple Man gained another independent duplicate, and when Boom-Boom was accidentally left behind she didn't seem to mind since she was being praised by the locals for her amazing mutant powers.</p><figure style=\"width: 201px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4226/174376-25889-sunspot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-174376\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"2.0845771144279\" data-width=\"201\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:208.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4226/174376-25889-sunspot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-174376\"><img alt=\"Coconut Grove Make-Over\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 201px) 100vw, 201px\" data-width=\"201\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4226/174376-25889-sunspot.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4226/174376-25889-sunspot.jpg 201w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Coconut Grove Make-Over\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4226/174376-25889-sunspot.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4226/174376-25889-sunspot.jpg 201w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 201px) 100vw, 201px\" data-width=\"201\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Coconut Grove Make-Over</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Gathering together, Multiple Man revealed that Cerebro had not been wrong earlier. He continued to read distinctive mutant signatures from both Ariel and Chance, except for when all their mutant powers were cancelled out when only Chance registered. They deduced that Chance could 'Double or Nothing' their powers by increasing them or completely removing them, and Ariel had the gift of the gab by being able to sweet talk others into doing what she wanted. The whole conversation had been overheard by Coconut Grove guards who informed their leader, Unipar.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">When the Coconut Grove guards attacked, the Fallen Angels were soon taken captive. Although Ariel's deal with Unipar meant that Chance was not to be taken too, they quickly seized her as they knew she was a mutant. Ariel turned to leave, so she didn't have to see the friends she'd betrayed, but then was immediately imprisoned within a force-field pillar. The captive Fallen Angels were thrown into a cell which dampened mutant powers, Gomi was blindfolded and locked inside a spinning cage, while Boom-Boom was being experimented on. Ariel remained inside her cramped pillar of energy, and was socially rejected by the rest of the team.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Unipar was determined to continue his experiments on the mutants. They would not go quietly, and therefore he shot the third Multiple Man duplicate. The death instantly sent a psychic feedback to the remaining Multiple Men and scared the others into silence. As all three Multiple Men were taken away, Sunspot offered to go to support his traumatised friend.</p><h3>Escape</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Due to his diminutive stature, Bill had remained undetected by the guards. The little green lobster cyborg made his way to the cells and battered any guard that was in his way. Finding the keys to the cell, he quickly liberated the team. They were ready to abandon Ariel, but took pity on her and freed her from the force-field pillar. They soon located Sunspot and the Multiple Men, who agreed to re-absorb and fight for their freedom.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Chance gained control over her powers and boosted the abilities of the others. Ariel used her voice based manipulation to convince Unipar to let them go. Devil Dinosaur destroyed the room and threatened savage violence if they were chased. Ultimately Unipar was informed that all of his scientific experiments were pointless, as their own kind had already begun to evolve again and Ariel was the living proof.</p><h3>The End</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ariel returned everyone back to the Beat Street Club. Sunspot and Warlock parted to return to school. Boom-Boom returned to X-Factor. Devil Dinosaur and Moon Boy were sent home to their jungle planet. Siryn and Multiple Man stayed with the remaining Fallen Angels saying that they were a good bunch who just needed a little guidance.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><p><strong>Trivia</strong></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The cover of the first issue of the series says \"One moment of anger, and their lives are changed forever\". Although this may seem as just a marketing gimmick there is a sense of truth in it.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">That is because all the events happening in this issue have impact right up until the end of \"The Fall of the Mutants\" story line, published in New Mutants 59-61. Because Sunspot hit Cannonball in rage after a game of footbal, he and Warlock left the New Mutants. They only came back at the end of \" The Fall of the Mutants\" story line. Just a few minutes after Sunspot and Warlock returned to help their teammates fight <a href=\"/cameron-hodge/4005-13379/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13379\">Cameron Hodge</a> and his elite robots, their friend and teammate Doug Ramsey (aka <a href=\"/cypher/4005-14559/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14559\">Cypher</a>) was shot and killed. Though nothing is certain, but it could be possible that, had Sunspot and Warlock stayed with the New Mutants, they could have turned the tied in favor of the mutants, and thus preventing the death of Doug.</p><h2>Epilogue</h2><h3>X-Team Adventures</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Eventually the rest of the team also disbanded. Gomi, Bill, Ariel and Chance have not been seen since, while Devil Dinosaur &amp; Moon Boy continue to re-appear in various places. Yet many of the other members have gone on to be in more popular teams, particularly X-Factor &amp; <a href=\"/x-force/4060-15595/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15595\">X-Force</a> Siryn and Multiple Man returned to <a href=\"/muir-island/4020-43505/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-43505\">Muir Island</a> at some undisclosed point, and were later mind controlled by the <a href=\"/shadow-king/4005-14889/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14889\">Shadow King</a></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Multiple Man joined the government backed incarnation of X-Factor and created X-Factor Investigates. Siryn became a long-time member of <a href=\"/cable/4005-2157/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2157\">Cable's</a> X-Force, and rejoined Multiple Man in X-Factor.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Boom-Boom was also a long-term member of Cable's X-Force with Siryn, and later had a brief relationship with Sunspot. He joined and left X-Force on various occasions and became a public figure when working with the <a href=\"/x-corporation/4060-40425/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40425\">X-Corporation</a>. He even became the Lord Imperial of the <a href=\"/hellfire-club/4060-13357/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13357\">Hellfire Club</a> before aiding the <a href=\"/young-x-men/4060-51146/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-51146\">Young X-Men</a> &amp; eventually reuniting with his New Mutants team-mates. Boom-Boom was a member of <a href=\"/nextwave/4060-40478/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40478\">NextWave</a> who fought an evil talking version of Devil Dinosaur who claimed he had eaten Moon Boy. Neither of them recalled their adventures together (although there are theories to state that was in an alternate reality).</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Warlock has returned from the dead, and returned to outer space where he attempts to cure the <a href=\"/kree/4060-7588/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-7588\">Kree</a> of the <a href=\"/technarchy/4060-49537/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-49537\">technarch</a> inflicted <a href=\"/techno-organic/4015-43631/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-43631\">techno-virus</a>. He has since sired a son of his own, and is slated to appear in the <a href=\"/new-mutants/4050-26327/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-26327\">New Mutants</a>. The Vanisher has been drafted into <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops</a> &amp; <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine's</a></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">X-Force. He had previously encountered the first X-Force during a heist on Hawaii where he did not recognise Siryn and even tried to chat her up. During the Second Coming event Vanisher was severely wound and presumed to have died.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ariel recently appeared aiding the X-Men during a riot in San Francisco and resided on Utopia. Unfortunatly she was killed in a car explosion during the Second Coming event.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><h2><strong>High School DXD</strong></h2><figure style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3333232\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111112793/3333232-9839348592-SubDE.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111112793/3333232-9839348592-SubDE.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3333232\"><img alt=\"Kokabiel\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111112793/3333232-9839348592-SubDE.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111112793/3333232-9839348592-SubDE.jpg 1280w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11111/111112793/3333232-9839348592-SubDE.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11111/111112793/3333232-9839348592-SubDE.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111112793/3333232-9839348592-SubDE.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Kokabiel\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111112793/3333232-9839348592-SubDE.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111112793/3333232-9839348592-SubDE.jpg 1280w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11111/111112793/3333232-9839348592-SubDE.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11111/111112793/3333232-9839348592-SubDE.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111112793/3333232-9839348592-SubDE.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Kokabiel</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">One of the three Supernatural Factions in High School DXD, along with Angels and Devils.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Fallen Angels are Angels that have fallen from the grace of God, due to having \"impure thoughts\" that divert them from the teachings of the God in the Bible.

Once, when <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\"> Wolverine</a> broke into the Club's Manhattan mansion, he severed Pierce's cybernetic arm from the rest of his body. Months later, Pierce rebelled against the rest of the Inner Circle, which was dominated by mutants led by Black King <a href=\"/sebastian-shaw/4005-2175/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2175\"> Sebastian Shaw</a>. Pierce abducted Shaw's aide <a href=\"/sage/4005-4559/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4559\"> Tessa</a> and held her captive. However, Pierce was thwarted by<a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\"> Professor Charles Xavier</a> and his new team, the <a href=\"/new-mutants/4060-15971/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15971\"> New Mutants</a>. Tessa regained her freedom, and Pierce was expelled from membership in the Inner Circle. Three other future members of the Reavers, <a href=\"/cole/4005-29212/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29212\"> Cole</a>, <a href=\"/macon/4005-29213/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29213\"> Macon</a>, and <a href=\"/reese/4005-15710/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15710\"> Reese</a>, were formerly mercenaries employed by the Inner Circle. On the same night that he first met Pierce, Wolverine also encountered a squad of Hellfire Club mercenaries who had been sent to find and kill him. Wolverine lashed out at three of them—Cole, Macon, and Reese—with his <a href=\"/adamantium/4055-40759/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40759\"> adamantium</a> claws, leaving the three of them severely wounded. The Inner Circle then had the three men converted into cyborgs. Cole, Macon, and Reese took Wolverine prisoner when the Inner Circle attacked the X-Men's Westchester County headquarters months later, but Wolverine overcame the three men once more. They were seen again working directly for Donald Pierce when he rebelled against the rest of the Hellfire Club.</p><p><a href=\"/lady-deathstrike/4005-8470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8470\"> Lady Deathstrike</a> had herself transformed into a cyborg by the other-dimensional being called <a href=\"/spiral/4005-9722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9722\"> Spiral</a>, in an attempt to gain the means to kill Wolverine, as adamantium had been bonded to his bones in a process stolen from her father,<a href=\"/lord-dark-wind/4005-19384/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19384\"> Lord Dark Wind</a>. She then led Cole, Macon, and Reese in an unsuccessful attempt to slay Wolverine in Manhattan.

Their base was a ghost town which was inexplicably equipped with advanced computers and a sub-basement and tunnel system. The Reavers coerced the mutant teleporter <a href=\"/gateway/4005-4646/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4646\"> Gateway </a>to teleport them from Australia to locations around the world to conduct their violent robberies. Informed of the Reavers' existence by <a href=\"/roma/4005-14810/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14810\"> Roma</a>, the X-Men expelled them from their Australian base, which they then co-opted for their own use. The X-Men destroyed some of the Reavers and forced most of the rest to enter the <a href=\"/siege-perilous/4055-40957/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40957\"> Siege Perilous</a>. However, three Reavers (<a href=\"/pretty-boy/4005-28113/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28113\"> Pretty Boy</a>, <a href=\"/skullbuster/4005-29211/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29211\"> Skullbuster</a>, and <a href=\"/bonebreaker/4005-28822/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28822\"> Bonebreaker</a>) escaped. The Reavers were then reassembled under the leadership of Donald Pierce. Pierce combined the three survivors of the original Reavers with Lady Deathstrike and the three former Hellfire Club mercenaries into a formidable team. While the X-Men, whose numbers had dwindled, were away from their Australian base, the Reavers retook the ghost town. When Wolverine returned from a leave of absence in <a href=\"/madripoor/4020-42665/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42665\"> Madripoor</a> to find the X-Men gone, he was taken by surprise, captured, tortured and crucified by the Reavers. Meanwhile, <a href=\"/psylocke/4005-3176/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3176\"> Psylocke </a>who had a premonition (her sporadic powers of precognition combining with Gateway's Aboriginal dreamtime) of danger waiting in the ghost town, took drastic action to escape when the X-Men were teleported back to the ghost town. Through telepathic mind control, she forced the remaining X-Men (herself included) to travel through the Siege Perilous, barely escaping the approaching Reavers and mystically re-birthing the X-Men elsewhere with no memory of their real lives. Wolverine later escapes the Reavers only with the aid of <a href=\"/jubilee/4005-4562/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4562\"> Jubilee</a>.</p><h3>Versus the Punisher</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-4416582\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11121/111219164/4416582-punisher%2033.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.2980935875217\" data-width=\"577\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 577px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:129.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11121/111219164/4416582-punisher%2033.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4416582\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px\" data-width=\"493\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11121/111219164/4416582-punisher%2033.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11121/111219164/4416582-punisher%2033.jpg 577w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11121/111219164/4416582-punisher%2033.jpg 493w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11121/111219164/4416582-punisher%2033.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11121/111219164/4416582-punisher%2033.jpg 577w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11121/111219164/4416582-punisher%2033.jpg 493w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px\" data-width=\"493\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Around this time, in <a href=\"/the-punisher-vol-2/4050-3855/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3855\"> Punisher Volume II</a> #33, three Reavers, Bonebreaker, Reese and Pretty Boy, are dispatched to a <a href=\"/new-york-state/4020-56310/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56310\"> New York</a> warehouse after <a href=\"/microchip/4005-1526/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1526\"> Microchip</a>, an associate of the <a href=\"/punisher/4005-1525/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1525\"> Punisher</a>, in a self-confessed mistake, infiltrates their computer system. The temporary absence of Gateway gives Punisher and Micro enough time to evacuate and set up resistance. One of the Reaver's biggest obstacles is a device designed by Micro, nicknamed Dalek. Its telescoping guns and multi-directional fire become very difficult to overcome. Even though, Punisher and Microchip barely survive. The Dalek and the warehouse are destroyed and the two escape through the sewer.</p><h3>Muir Island</h3><p>The Reavers then attacked <a href=\"/muir-island/4020-43505/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-43505\"> Muir Island</a>, theorizing that it was Wolverine's most likely destination.

Durimg the attack, Skullbuster was rendered inoperative by sniper fire from <a href=\"/forge/4005-4279/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4279\"> Forge</a>. Despite this loss, the Reavers managed to take out a number of mutants.

They later return to battle the X-Treme X-Men on behalf of the <a href=\"/shadow-king/4005-14889/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14889\"> Shadow King</a>.</p><h3>New Reavers: Academy X</h3><p>Donald Pierce puts together a new group of Reavers, composed of young anti- mutant humans. This includes <a href=\"/elixir/4005-4552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4552\"> Elixir</a>, who at the time was unaware that he was a mutant. They are defeated by a de-facto new version of the New Mutants. Pierce himself has the skin decayed from his body by Wither. He is turned over to the police. Pierce had injured Wallflower during the battle. Elixir saves her, when his former comrades learn of this, they give him a beating and kick him out of the organization. The group later breaks Pierce out of prison and makes another attempt on Elixir's life, but they are defeated by the surviving core members of the original New Mutants team.</p><h3>Messiah Complex</h3><p>The Reavers returned to play a role in the current Messiah Complex event, under the leadership of Lady Deathstrike. Judging from the design of their costumes, as well as their rhetoric in battle, these newest Reavers are simply existing members of the Purifiers upgraded with cybernetics rather than classic members of the team. Deployed as an elite commando unit designed to eliminate organized mutant resistance, the Reavers manage to track down and confront Cable in Alberta, Canada before being attacked by the new X-Force. In the ensuing battle, Deathstrike and the Reavers are all terminated by Wolverine's strike team, but not before killing the mutant Caliban and injuring Cable. Whether Deathstrike survived the clash, or whether the Purifiers will be able to upgrade more of their fighters with Reaver technology to replace the ones lost in Canada, remains to be seen.</p><p> </p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><p><strong>Earth 295 (Age of Apocalypse)</strong></p><p>The Reavers in this alternate reality were headed by Donald Pierce and made up of members <a href=\"/clegg/4005-41007/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41007\"> Clegg</a>, <a href=\"/dead-eye/4005-61370/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61370\"> Dead Eye</a>, Mangle, Slocum, and Vultura. They were human beings that were altered by Apocalypse with the Techno-Organic Virus. Put in charge of stopping the Human High Council's plan to use nuclear weapons to stop Apocalypse, they brainwashed <a href=\"/captain-britain/4005-7477/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7477\"> Captain Britain</a> and attacked Wolverine, <a href=\"/ms-marvel/4005-21561/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21561\"> Carol Danvers</a>, and Gateway. Eventually, all of their members were defeated.</p><p><strong>Earth 1610 (Ultimate Reavers)</strong></p><p>Rather than being a specific team of super-villains, the Ultimate continuity's version of the Reavers are human gladiators who have undergone surgery to become cyborgs for the specific purpose of hunting down mutants on live television. They are led by Ultimate <a href=\"/deadpool/4005-7606/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7606\"> Deadpool</a>. Some do retain the names of the 616 Reavers, such as 'Bonebreaker'.</p><p> </p><p> </p>",

    "description": "<p>The Upstarts are a group of <a data-ref-id=\"4015-40656\" href=\"/mutant/4015-40656/\">            Mutant</a>s (and one human) who were vying for leadership of their own group and were given points for assassinating mutant figures. The Upstarts included:  <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9704\" href=\"/shinobi-shaw/4005-9704/\">            Shinobi Shaw</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14865\" href=\"/siena-blaze/4005-14865/\">            Siena Blaze</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9728\" href=\"/fabian-cortez/4005-9728/\">            Fabian Cortez</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13351\" href=\"/graydon-creed/4005-13351/\">            Graydon Creed</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-8300\" href=\"/trevor-fitzroy/4005-8300/\">            Trevor Fitzroy</a> and the   <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56925\" href=\"/fenris/4060-56925/\">      Fenris</a> Twins, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4814\" href=\"/andrea-strucker/4005-4814/\">            Andrea Strucker</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4815\" href=\"/andreas-strucker/4005-4815/\">            Andreas Strucker</a>. The Upstarts were responsible for most of the death's of the original <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3199\" href=\"/hellions/4060-3199/\">            Hellions</a> and the apparent deaths of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\" href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\">            Magneto</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2175\" href=\"/sebastian-shaw/4005-2175/\">            Sebastian Shaw</a>. </p><h2>The Upstarts!</h2><p>Many members of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-13357\" href=\"/hellfire-club/4060-13357/\">            Hellfire Club</a>'s <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57190\" href=\"/inner-circle/4060-57190/\">            The Inner Circle</a> have had their hands in the creation of many power teams. These teams were used to further the creator’s power. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2176\" href=\"/selene/4005-2176/\">            Selene</a> (the Black Queen of the Inner Circle) would be no different. As the White Queen (<a data-ref-id=\"4005-1457\" href=\"/emma-frost/4005-1457/\">            Emma Frost</a>) made a team of young/adolescent mutants, called the Hellions, to solidify her role in the Hellfire Club. Selene, too, would create a team of young, mutant adults though for, it would seem, more honorable reasons. Selene was to use the team to mold and create the future mutant leaders of the world. Though with Selene, there is always more then meets the eye. Selene would have an ulterior motive for the team know as The Upstarts!</p><a href=\"/\"> </a><h2>The Players</h2><p>Selene was very particular about those that she would recruit into the team. Only wanting the young, wealthy, powerful and elite. Those who would be powerful leaders in the future. Her only other criteria would be that they MUST be mutants. </p><p>The initial roster would include:</p><p>__<a data-ref-id=\"4005-8300\" href=\"/trevor-fitzroy/4005-8300/\">            Trevor Fitzroy</a>__: The teleporting, time traveling mutant from the future.</p><p>__<a data-ref-id=\"4005-9704\" href=\"/shinobi-shaw/4005-9704/\">            Shinobi Shaw</a>__: The phasing son of the Inner Circle's Black King, Sebastion Shaw. Cunning and sly, Shinobi Shaw is willing to betray and do anything in order to further his self. </p><p>Other would join later in the game such as:</p><p>__<a data-ref-id=\"4005-14865\" href=\"/siena-blaze/4005-14865/\">            Siena Blaze</a>__: wielding energies so powerful, each use depleted Earth further as her power were detrimental to the environment.</p><p>__<a data-ref-id=\"4005-13351\" href=\"/graydon-creed/4005-13351/\">            Graydon Creed</a>(Tribune)__: the only baseline human, and future presidential candidate, to join the team also the mutant hating biological son of both <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1469\" href=\"/mystique/4005-1469/\">            Mystique</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4563\" href=\"/sabretooth/4005-4563/\">            Sabretooth</a>.</p><p>__<a data-ref-id=\"4005-23530\" href=\"/fenris/4005-23530/\">            Fenris</a>__: Twin Nazi sympathizers who require skin-to-skin contact with each other to enable use of their powers. (Probationary Member)</p><p>__<a data-ref-id=\"4005-15117\" href=\"/matsuo-tsurayaba/4005-15117/\">            Matsuo Tsurayaba</a>__: powerful member of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-1800\" href=\"/the-hand/4060-1800/\">            The Hand</a>. (Probationary Member)</p><p>The team would need one last person, someone who could monitor and judge the competitions for the group, a referee of sorts. Selene would get in contact with an omnipathic mutant, with mental powers on par with both <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\" href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\">            Professor X</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\" href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\">            Jean Grey</a>, by name of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14866\" href=\"/gamesmaster/4005-14866/\">            Gamesmaster</a>. Though Selene organized/founded the team, he would monitor them and keep track of points to see who the winner of each game would be.</p><p>The Upstarts were unlike any other team. In joining the team each member was part of a secret competition, or games as they are referred to as being. Basically the group would be given targets (groups of people or individuals) and the Upstarts would have to assassinate them. Gamesmaster would award points based on the victim’s power, skill and their overall importance to the world. Points and competition were decided solely by Gamesmaster. The winner for smaller games would gain leadership of the Upstarts with complete loyalty and power granted to that person while they were wearing \"the ring.\" The ring signifies who the winner was. Selene also eluded that the grand prize would be immortality, a prize that each member wanted greatly. </p><p>In order to join the team one requirement must be met. The individual requesting membership would have to kill a member of the Inner Circle. In the beginning, things went smoothly and as planned. Resulting in many major events such as: The decimation and deaths of almost all of the Hellions as well as the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-9726\" href=\"/reavers/4060-9726/\">            Reavers</a>. Additionally, the apparent deaths of Sebastion Shaw (Black King), Emma Frost (White Queen), Eric Lensherr (Magneto/ White King) &amp; <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3556\" href=\"/donald-pierce/4005-3556/\">            Donald Pierce</a> (White Rook). Selene's hidden agenda couldn't be going any better.</p><a href=\"/\"> </a><h2>Selene's Secret Plan</h2><p>In appearance, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2176\" href=\"/selene/4005-2176/\">           Selene</a> would make it seem as though her reasoning for the team was completely honorable. Only wanting to find and mold the future mutant leaders of the world. A humanitarian effort if ever there was one. Though not all was as it seemed. True, she did want to find the future leaders, but this would be to fit her needs. There was a power struggle, one of huge proportions, in one of the most powerful factions in the world. It was in the Inner Circle of the Hellfire Club. Each of the members was plotting against one another. Deception, lies and manipulation; these were a regular thing and was what was to be expected. Selene, the Black Queen of the Inner Circle would be no different.</p><p>Her goal was simple, she wanted full control of the Inner Circle and in effect the Hellfire Club. This would never happen with the current members as they all wanted the same exact thing. So she would pick individuals with the powers and abilities to assassinate/kill those currently in the Inner Circle. She would sugar-coat the actions by calling it a competition or game. With each completed game another part of the Inner Circle would be removed, from the actual members to their followers. This would only leave Selene to be in the fullest control of the group. Here are some of the initial games.<br /></p><p>-Payment for membership would be to kill one of the current members of the Inner Circle.</p><p>-Destroy any of the personal teams the Inner circles may have. i.e. the Reaver's who were the followers of Donald Pierce (White Rook).</p><p>-Kill the Hellions, loyal to Emma Frost the White Queen, and potential Inner Circle recruits in the future.</p><p>-The total annihilation of the entire group of the Inner Circle, excluding Selene.</p><p>If the ploy was successful there would only be the Black Queen, Selene, with all the power to herself. She would then have her team fill the emptied spot to create a new Inner Circle. Though as it would shortly be seen, Selene wasn't the only one playing a game for their own benefit. One, of the Upstarts would soon have plans of his own, that none were aware of. And there wasn't a thing anyone could do to stop him.</p> <br /><a href=\"/\"> </a><h2>The Gamesmaster</h2><p>The <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14866\" href=\"/gamesmaster/4005-14866/\">          Gamesmaster'</a>s role was to be the quiet background member. He was only to be the referee with no other real role on the team. In actuality he was getting taken advantage of by Selene, only wanting him for his mental powers, powers that she would underestimate. Gamesmaster was no regular telepath, he was an omnipath with mental gifts so powerful any average telepath's mind would burn out. His mental powers were at such a level that he is linked/connected to every single mind on the world 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. More then 6 million people's thoughts coursing through his mind all at one time. Even the powerful Professor X would not withstand that duress. He would find ease when he was asked to join the Upstarts. He found that when focusing on specific sets on individuals, rather then trying to block everyone’s thoughts, it would ease his pain. Gamesmaster enjoyed the games, he found the interesting, and especially liked the reprieve from the pain of his powers. The problem was that Selene's game was soon to end, and the game would be over. Or so she thought.<br /></p><br /><p><br /></p> <a href=\"/\"> </a><h2>The Gamesmaster's Game</h2><p>Selene No More</p><p>The Gamesmaster couldn't allow the games to end; he enjoyed them, to make them continue he would have to do a little manipulating, himself. Gamesmaster would have to use his powers in a way that he had never tried. He would have to mentally control another person to put his plans into play. Considering his amazing telepathic might, it shouldn't be a problem. He would select the maniacal Fitzroy. While Controlling Fitzroy he would have him use his powers to capture Selene. Fitzroy would prove successful and even put her in a torture machine from the future. All her experiences in her long life, battling some of the most powerful heroes from the X-Men and Excalibur, while all ranging from life threatening to simply casting a spell, they have not prepared her for such physical pain. Otherwise known as “spooling” the process involves being ripped to shreds and then reformed over and over and over again. Needless to say the pain was exquisite. Fitzroy fail-proofed his plan as well. The only way she could be freed is if someone took her place in the machine. No one in there right mind would do that, so Selene would be stuck their. Gamesmaster also fail-proofed his plan. If Selene, by chance, did free herself, she would blame Fitzroy, not the true person behind it. Once Selene was out of the way, Gamesmaster could use the Upstarts to his hearts content. He would control them and their lives like a game of chess. He would never have to worry of ramifications either, as he would never have physical contact with the teams either, since all connections with them would be through the astral plane. It was the perfect plan.</p><br /><h2>Let The New Games Begin!</h2><p>Gamesmaster would now play an even larger role in the Upstarts. No longer simply a referee, he was participating in the games by manipulating and controlling his team. When he took over, new members would join like: Tribune (Graydon Creed), Fenris and Matsu'o from The Hand.</p><p>The games that he created were one the same path as those in the beginning. He would select target and this Upstarts would have to assassinate them for points. He picked some very hard targets and in most cases not successful at his attempts. Some of the targets were <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4279\" href=\"/forge/4005-4279/\">            Forge</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\" href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\">            Cyclops</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1444\" href=\"/storm/4005-1444/\">            Storm</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\" href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\">            Professor X</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-8304\" href=\"/moira-mactaggert/4005-8304/\">            Moira MacTaggert</a> and in one a death wasn't required. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3179\" href=\"/mr-sinister/4005-3179/\">            Mr. Sinister</a> hired the team to attain D.N.A. from <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2165\" href=\"/proteus/4005-2165/\">            Proteus</a> instead return with the D.N.A. of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3566\" href=\"/marvel-girl/4005-3566/\">            Marvel Girl</a> (Rachel Summers, then using Phoenix as her code-name.) Gamesmaster had many games, some time multiple one at any given time. None would require more effort from him and his team the Upstarts, then the final one that they would participate in together.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------       </p><a href=\"/\"> </a><h2>Young Hunt / Child's Play</h2><p>Coming full circle Gamesmaster would have his final targets be the ones that got away in the very first game. The new/old target are the remaining living original <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3199\" href=\"/hellions/4060-3199/\">            Hellions</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4060-15971\" href=\"/new-mutants/4060-15971/\">            New Mutants</a> (in actuality all the remaining living New Mutants, save a few were all Hellions). Though now, these are no longer young, novice mutants who could get easily pushed over. Both teams are older, more experienced and are very spread out. They are all spread out out now and apart of different teams such as: <a data-ref-id=\"4060-15595\" href=\"/x-force/4060-15595/\">            X-Force</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4060-28349\" href=\"/mutant-liberation-front/4060-28349/\">            Mutant Liberation Front</a> (MLF) and <a data-ref-id=\"4060-11896\" href=\"/new-warriors/4060-11896/\">            New Warriors</a>. There were quite a few targets that the members of the Upstarts were to take on, including: <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2173\" href=\"/empath/4005-2173/\">            Empath</a>, Thunderbird(now known as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2158\" href=\"/warpath/4005-2158/\">            Warpath</a>), <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2101\" href=\"/firestar/4005-2101/\">            Firestar</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4558\" href=\"/magma/4005-4558/\">            Magma</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1496\" href=\"/cannonball/4005-1496/\">            Cannonball</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2159\" href=\"/boom-boom/4005-2159/\">            Boom Boom</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9849\" href=\"/karma/4005-9849/\">            Karma</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1463\" href=\"/moonstar/4005-1463/\">            Moonstar</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10988\" href=\"/rictor/4005-10988/\">            Rictor</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4557\" href=\"/wolfsbane/4005-4557/\">            Wolfsbane</a>. The key difference in this game is that Gamesmaster didn't want the captives to be killed, only captured.  It can only be assumed that he grew bored with the Upstarts and was to use the captives mutants as his new pawns. His ploy was nearly successful and would have won if not for one, Paige Guthrie, the future <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\" href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\">            X-Men</a> known as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3426\" href=\"/husk/4005-3426/\">            Husk</a> and little sister of Cannonball.</p><a href=\"/\"> </a><h2>The New Game</h2><p>To Control The Future</p><p>Gamesmaster was always ready for a new challenging game, especially the one posed to him. Paige challenged the Gamesmaster to a race. A race to locate and control the future mutants of the world. She stated that Professor X, Magneto and the Hellfire Club would all be trying to find them as well. Being intrigued by the challenge, he quickly decides that he no longer had interest in the Young Hunt. He called the game off and released all his mentally captives ex-member's of the New Mutants and the Hellions. Not only would he call and end to the current game but he would follow that with the disbanding of the Upstarts. He felt that he no longer required them as he could continue his game alone.</p><a href=\"/\"> </a><h2>Where Are They Now</h2><p>It not likely that the Upstarts are to regroup and make an appearance. Many have passed away, unfortunately have this status be much more permanent the some of the \"death\" that they dealt out on their targets. Here is an update on the status' of each of the members.</p><p>Selene: is still actively scheming away hiding in the dark. She recently came into the company of the young mutant Wither and has plans in place for the both of them. Though nothing has been revealed about it.</p><p>Gamesmaster: After the Upstarts were disbanded, he would show up a few more times doing battle with the likes of both the X-Men and X-Force. After a lose at the hands of Jean Grey he seemingly disappeared. Though being that he is a telepath of high order, he may simply be hiding his presence till the right time.</p><p>Trevor Fitzroy: Though he would continue to wreak havok for many years to come he would finally run into his enemy from the future, Bishop, and be dispatched. It appears that his death is a permanent one.</p><p>Siena Blaze: Though she had immeasurable and deadly mutant energies at her disposal, in the end it wouldn't matter. She along with hundreds of other mutants would be captured and sent to Neverland, a facility ran by Weapon X. She would ultimately be placed in a gas chamber and be killed. Her power's would matter not as the building was harnessing the power dampening mutant Leech's powers to effectively depower all mutants in the vicinity.</p><p>Shinobi Shaw: Though he thought he was successful in his ploy to kill his father, he would be wrong. His father would reappear, very much, alive.
