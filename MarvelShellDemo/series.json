Written by John Semper Jr and produced by Marvel Films Animation, the series adapted several classic Spider-Man stories and featured a crossover with <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/xmen-the-animated-series/4075-26/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-26\">X-Men: The Animated Series</a>.</p><p>Hugely successful around the world, Spider-Man: The Animated Series is generally acclaimed to be the most accurate TV adaptation of the famous web-slinger.

Other X-Men teams, such as <a href=\"/x-factor/4060-24131/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-24131\">X-Factor</a>, also appeared multiple times in the show.

The series was originally intended to finish with Season 4 but 8 more episodes were ordered at the last minute resulting in the fifth season which featured animation by a different studio and many voice actors being replaced.</p>",

The show is animated in the style of Silver Surfer creator <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\">Jack Kirby</a>. It is also one of the first animated shows to incorporate computer animation, with characters such as Galactus being entirely compter generated. </p><p>Due to Marvel's bankrupcy issues at the time, the series only lasted for 13 episodes, although eight episodes for a second season had already been written. Those episodes never reached production, which is very unfortunate as the final episode of the first season was a multi-episode story. The final epsiode ends with 'The End?', making the series an unfinished cliffhanger. </p><p> </p>",

Along the way he encounters Counter-Earth versions of Green Goblin, The Vulture, Electro and Kraven the Hunter, while being chased by some animal and human hybrids and chasing Venom and Carnage before they find the mysterious Synoptic.</p><p> </p><h4><strong>Reception</strong></h4><p>This animated series was critically panned by fans and critics for it's offbeat tone and as a result, it was short lived and lasted for only 13 episodes in total.

    "description": "<h3><strong>Plot</strong></h3><p> </p><h4><strong>Season 1 (13 Episodes)</strong></h4><p>As previously stated in the description, Peter Parker is still trying to balance his hero life and normal life. The series takes place in the aftermath of the film, Spider-Man. Norman Osborn is dead in this series, thus making his best friend, Harry Osborn, having a vendetta against the web-head. Peter, Harry and MJ still attend Empire State University. All things were not going as he wanted when he has a sudden attraction to Indira Daimonji, an original character for the show. She serves as a foil to their relationship. Along the way, he fights KGB terrorists, a gadget using Robin Hood, a bird-themed thief, a brainiac kind of villain, sibling telepaths,a psychotic fan girl, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/lizard/4005-1488/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1488\">a monstrous reptile</a>, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/kingpin/4005-1483/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1483\">a manipulative mob-boss</a> , <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/electro/4005-3228/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3228\">a shocking electrician</a>, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/kraven-the-hunter/4005-2475/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2475\">a murderous hunter</a> and assassins, including a magical sword wielding ninja, a fish-themed killer and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/silver-sable/4005-7608/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7608\">a female trained professional</a>.</p><p> </p><h4><strong>Season 2 (No Episodes)</strong></h4><p>The final episode was forced to end in a cliffhanger due to low ratings. According to director, Brandon Vietti, Season 2 would have featured <a href=\"/mysterio/4005-4333/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4333\">a master of illusions</a>, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/vulture/4005-4459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4459\">an old bird brain</a> and still the murderous hunter.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Reception</strong></h3><p>Though ratings were low, it has received positive reviews because of it's dark tone and fresh take on the traditional web-head's adventures, including it's animation. On the contrary, some fans and critics question the use of original characters when there are numerous characters usable. It was nominated for two Annie Awards.</p><h3><strong>Trivia</strong></h3><p>This series was originally planned to be adaptations of <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/brian-michael-bendis/4040-40435/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40435\">Brian Michael Bendis</a>'s fan-favorite run of <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/ultimate-spider-man/4050-7257/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-7257\">Ultimate Spider-Man</a>. However, due to the success of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man movie, the series plans was changed, making the continuation to the film. Bendis's run would be adapetd to Disney's <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/ultimate-spiderman/4075-13/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-13\">Ultimate Spider-Man</a> TV Series. The original artwork featured Ultimate counter-parts of <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/rhino/4005-2126/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2126\">a dumb muscleman</a>, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/doctor-octopus/4005-1485/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1485\">a scientific octopus</a> and <a href=\"/vulture-drago/4005-62054/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62054\">a bird-brain wannabe</a> (this bird brain can possibly be the older version).</p><p> </p><p>In the episode, Mind Games: Part Two, Peter gave up his identity as Spider-man after his meeting with his enemies and the entire New York started to hate him. This event also happened the same time <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/spider-man-2/4025-42/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-42\">Spider-Man 2</a> was shown, where in he also started to retire as Spider-Man after believing he may not be meant to be Spider-man after all.

Critical reception to the series were initially mixed. Many critics and fans criticize the idea of making Iron Man and most of his supporting characters younger than their comic book counterparts. A lot also commented that the graphics and the characters were uninteresting and it feels like that the tone is completely departed from the comics. Also, a lot of viewers commented that Tony's origin story is very similar to that of <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man</a>. On the bright side, the storytelling was lauded by many because of it's surprisingly good way of telling a story with the people praising the idea of departing from the cinematic take of Iron Man. It won 1 Pulcinella Award for Best TV Series for Teens.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>",

According to Tom Tataranowicz, the supervising prodcuer of Season 2, they would've adapted the story line containing Invisible Woman's pregnancy and their own version of Namor. They would also have made <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/she-hulk/4005-1449/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1449\">She-Hulk</a> and Medusa as temporary members of the team.</p><p> </p><h4><strong>Reception</strong></h4><p>Critical reception for the first season was overall negative. It was heavily criticized for it's campy tone, poor animation, several inconsistencies in each episodes and nearly predictable story lines. Because of it's terrible results, the show was forced to be produced under a new studio (Season 2). Though it was slightly praised for being reliable to the source material. For Season 2, the reception became more positive because of it's darker tone. But the ratings continued to drop after suffering from the first season's outcome, thus cancelling the series.</p><p> </p><p>Note: All episodes are arranged according to production date not by air date.</p>",
